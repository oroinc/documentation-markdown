# Frontend Developer Guide

This documentation provides instruction on how to customize OroPlatform-based applications look and feel with themes.

There are two types of themes:

> - [Storefront themes](storefront/index.md#dev-doc-frontend-storefront) used for OroCommerce storefront
> - [Back-Office themes](back-office/index.md#dev-doc-frontend-back-office-theming) used for Oro application back-office

#### HINT
Back-office themes cannot be used in the storefront and vice-versa.

[Storefront Design](storefront-design/index.md#frontend-storefront-design) guides you on how to create and customize OroPlatform-based application UI using Sketch.

All the themes use the same [Javascript Architecture](javascript/index.md#dev-doc-frontend-javascript) except for the way the JS modules are registered.

[Right to Left UI Support](rtl-support.md#frontend-rtl-support) guides you on how to enable “Right to Left” text direction UI.
