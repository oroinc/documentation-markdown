# Storefront Style Guide

The Storefront Style Guide is a collection of examples and user interface behaviors for designers. It contains a color palette, typography, interface elements (forms, buttons, tables, etc.), that serves as a checklist for designers, which will make it possible to eliminate omissions and inaccuracies when creating the OroCommerce theme design.

#### HINT
The relations of the interface elements with style (color palette, font properties) coincide with the logic embedded in the Storefront theme.
