# Principles

The Atomic Design approach is used in the structure of the user interface, which means that all functional elements consist of:

* [Atoms](atoms.md#principles-atoms) - the smallest elements that cannot be separated and that serve as elementary blocks of the interface (colors, typography, buttons, icons, etc.)
* [Molecules](molecules.md#principles-molecules) - groups of atoms that form relatively simple functional interface elements (pop-up, button with dropdown, navigation menu)
* [Organisms](organisms.md#principles-organisms) - groups of molecules that form the relatively complex parts of the interface (header, footer, sidebar)
* [Templates](templates.md#principles-templates) - help place components in the layout and demonstrate the content structure underlying the design
* [Pages](pages.md#principles-pages) - help apply real content to templates displaying the final interface
