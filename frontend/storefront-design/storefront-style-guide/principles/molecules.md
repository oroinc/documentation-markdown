# Molecules

By combining atoms into groups, we get molecules - functional elements of the interface. For example, combining the input with two buttons, we get the form for editing the title of the shopping list. An input atom enables you to enter a name, while button atoms will allow you to accept or reject the form.

Using molecules enables your interface to be always consistent and intuitive to use.
