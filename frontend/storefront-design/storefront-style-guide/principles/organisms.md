# Organisms

Organisms are relatively complex user interface components consisting of groups of molecules and/or atoms, and/or other organisms. These organisms form separate parts of the interface.

For example, the OroCommerce Storefront has a header, which consists of molecules and atoms:

* Login links, contact information (atoms)
* Logo (atom)
* Search field (a molecule containing an atom of the input field and search icon)
* Navigation menu (a molecule consisting of menu items-atoms), etc.

The organism is a self-contained, isolated interface element that can exist independently.
