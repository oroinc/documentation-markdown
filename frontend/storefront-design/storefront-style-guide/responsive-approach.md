# Responsive Approach

Responsive web design is an approach to web design that makes web pages render well on a variety of devices and windows or screen sizes. Content, design, and performance are necessary across all devices to ensure usability and satisfaction.

Breakpoints are points of adjustment of the interface following the resolution of the display. For the correct implementation of the theme design, designers need to provide interface designs in the following resolutions (horizontal):

* 320px - small mobile device
* 768px - tablet
* 1440px - desktop
