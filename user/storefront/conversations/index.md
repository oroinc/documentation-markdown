# Manage Conversations in the Storefront

Oro provides a conversation tool designed for communication both within the back-office and storefront environments. This tool enables communication between back-office users and customers users.

Each conversation consists of a set of messages that can be sent by [back-office users](../../back-office/activities/conversations/index.md#doc-activities-conversations) or customer users.

## Start a New Conversation

To start a new conversation in the storefront:

1. Navigate to **Profiles & Addresses > Conversations** in the menu
2. Click **Create Conversation** on the top right.
