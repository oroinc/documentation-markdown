# Create an Order via Matrix Form in the Storefront

To simplify ordering process when purchasing several variations of one product, such as a USB flash drive in various colors and capacity, you can use a **Matrix Form**. The matrix form is available only when a **product has one or two attributes**.

Depending on the configuration:

1. The matrix form can be displayed:
   * on a product page:

   * on the product listing:

   * as a popup when clicking the **Update Shopping List** button on the product page.

2. Enter the number of items for each category.
3. Click **Add to Shopping List** on the bottom right of the matrix ordering form. Alternatively, select the shopping list to add the items to, or create a new shopping list by clicking <i class="fa fa-chevron-down fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> and selecting your option.
