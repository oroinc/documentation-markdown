# Manage Orders in the Storefront

There are two ways to create an [order](../../glossary.md#term-Order) in the storefront:

* From a shopping list
* From a quick order form

After you submit an order, it becomes available in the [Order History](../account/order-history.md#my-account-order-history) menu which you can reach via the Quick Access menu under **Orders**. Here, you can review ordered items, view order billing and shipping information and re-order products from previous orders.
