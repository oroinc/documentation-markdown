# Create a Guest RFQ in the Storefront

<!-- begin -->

In the Oro application, guest customers can create a request for a quote for the items they are interested in purchasing without the need to register, if [this option was configured in the back-office](../../../back-office/system/configuration/commerce/sales/guest-quote.md#sys-conf-commerce-guest-enable-guest-quotes).

Guest RFQs can be created from the shopping list and a quick order form.

#### NOTE
Guest users can receive quotes via a direct ink to the provided email. Learn how in the [Send a Guest Quote](../../../back-office/sales/quotes/guest-quote.md#user-guide-sales-guest-quotes) topic.
