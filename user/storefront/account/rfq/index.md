# Manage Requests for Quote in the Storefront

To negotiate with the sales person (e.g. on a better price, more convenient quantities and additional services), you can request a quote. Both registered and guest users can create [RFQs](../../../glossary.md#term-Request-for-Quote) in the Oro storefront.

To reach RFQ menu:

1. Navigate to **Account** in the [user menu](../../getting-started/general-layout.md#frontstore-guide-navigation-user-menu).
2. Click **Request for Quote** in the menu on the left.
