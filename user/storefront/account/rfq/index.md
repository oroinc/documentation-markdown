# Manage Requests for Quote in the Storefront

To negotiate with the sales person (e.g. on a better price, more convenient quantities and additional services), you can request a quote. Both registered and guest users can create [RFQs](../../../glossary.md#term-Request-for-Quote) in the Oro storefront.

Registered users can view all existing Requests for Quote or create new ones in their storefront account by clicking Requests for Quote in the user menu in the top navigation bar.
