# Manage Quotes in the Storefront

The Quotes section provides the details on all your created and submitted quotes. Here, you can negotiate with sales representatives on requesting a better price, more convenient quantities and additional services, view, accept, and submit an order based on the offered prices and conditions. In the storefront, this page is nested under the **Quotes** section of the user menu.

Here, you can also print the quote, accept it and submit to order, or start a [conversation](../conversations/index.md#storefront-guide-conversations) by clicking **Ask a question**.

Within the table you have the following [action buttons](../getting-started/common-controls.md#frontstore-guide-navigation-action-buttons) available:

1. Refresh ![Refresh-SVG](_themes/sphinx_rtd_theme/static/svg-icons/refresh.svg) the view table.
2. Reset ![Reset-SVG](_themes/sphinx_rtd_theme/static/svg-icons/reset.svg) the view table to clear view table customization and return to default settings. Reset applies to all filters, records per page and sorting changes that you have made.
3. Manage ![Columns-SVG](_themes/sphinx_rtd_theme/static/svg-icons/columns.svg) table settings to define which columns to show in the table.
4. Manage [filters](../getting-started/common-controls.md#frontstore-guide-navigation-filters) ![Settings-SVG](_themes/sphinx_rtd_theme/static/svg-icons/settings.svg).
