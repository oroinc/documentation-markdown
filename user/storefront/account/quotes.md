# Manage Quotes in the Storefront

The Quotes section provides the details on all your created and submitted quotes. Here, you can negotiate with sales representatives on requesting a better price, more convenient quantities and additional services, view, accept, and submit an order based on the offered prices and conditions. In the storefront, this page is nested under the **Quotes** section of the user menu.

The All Quotes page contains the following information:

1. Quote #
2. Status
3. PO Number
4. Ship by
5. Created At
6. Valid Until
7. Owner
8. More Actions (View)

Here, you can also print the quote, accept it and submit to order, or start a [conversation](../conversations/index.md#storefront-guide-conversations) by clicking **Ask a question**.

Within the table you have the following [action buttons](../getting-started/common-controls.md#frontstore-guide-navigation-action-buttons) available:

1. Refresh ![Refresh-SVG](_themes/sphinx_rtd_theme/static/svg-icons/refresh.svg) the view table.
2. Reset ![Reset-SVG](_themes/sphinx_rtd_theme/static/svg-icons/reset.svg) the view table to clear view table customization and return to default settings. Reset applies to all filters, records per page and sorting changes that you have made.
3. Manage ![Columns-SVG](_themes/sphinx_rtd_theme/static/svg-icons/columns.svg) table settings to define which columns to show in the table.
4. Manage [filters](../getting-started/common-controls.md#frontstore-guide-navigation-filters) ![Settings-SVG](_themes/sphinx_rtd_theme/static/svg-icons/settings.svg).

If a quote is related to an RFQ, you can navigate to its page via a dedicated link on the quote page.
