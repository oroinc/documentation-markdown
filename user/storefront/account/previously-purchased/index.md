#### NOTE
The Previously Purchased section of the storefront can be enabled or disabled by the website administrator depending on the business and website requirements.

From the Previously Purchased section, you can:

* View all your previously purchased products and their price.
* Provide product quantity, add products to [the shopping list(s)](../shopping-lists/index.md#frontstore-guide-shopping-lists) and [create a new shopping list](../shopping-lists/index.md#frontstore-guide-shopping-lists-create).
* [Filter](../../getting-started/common-controls.md#frontstore-guide-navigation-filters) products by text, name, SKU, price, and other attributes related to the products displayed on this page.
* Sort them by name, SKU, recency, price, and other product attributes.

By default, previously purchased products are sorted by recency with the newest items displayed first.
