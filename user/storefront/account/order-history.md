# Manage Order History in the Storefront

The Order History section stores the information on all your open and submitted orders. Here, you can check the details on the order number, the date it was created, the address this order was shipped to, the total amount, the payment method and the payment status.

To open the **Order History** menu:

1. Click **Account** in the [user menu](../getting-started/general-layout.md#frontstore-guide-navigation-user-menu) on the top left of the page.
2. Under **Account**, click **Order History**.

The Order History page contains two sections:

* All open orders
* All past orders

From the all open orders table, you can:

* Click the order in the table to open it.
* Click <i class="fa fa-shopping-cart" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Check Out** at the end of the row to proceed to the checkout. You will be redirected to the ordering process page (the step where you left off).
* Click <i class="fas fa-trash-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Delete** at the end of the row to delete an open order.

From the all past orders table, you can:

* Click <i class="fa fa-eye fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> **View** at the end of the row to view an order or click the order to open it. To return to the Order History page, click **Back to Orders List** on the bottom left of the view page.
* Click <i class="fa fa-shopping-cart" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Re-Order** at the end of the row to submit the same order

Information displayed in the tables depends on the columns selected in the <i class="fa fa-cog fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> grid settings. Within each of the tables, you have the following [action buttons](../getting-started/common-controls.md#frontstore-guide-navigation-action-buttons) available:

* Refresh the view table: click <i class="fas fa-sync-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i> to update the view table.
* Reset the view table: click <i class="fas fa-sync-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i> to clear view table customization and return to default settings. Reset applies to all filters, records per page and sorting changes that you have made.
* Adjust the table settings: click <i class="fa fa-cog fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> to define which columns to show in the table.
* Filter the displayed orders: click <i class="fa fa-filter fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> [Filters](../getting-started/common-controls.md#frontstore-guide-navigation-filters) .

#### NOTE
More details on how to review ordered items, billing and shipping information, and re-order products from the previous orders are described in the [Orders](../orders/index.md#frontstore-guide-orders) section of the Storefront guide.
