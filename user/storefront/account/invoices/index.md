# Manage Invoices in the Storefront

The Invoices feature enables customer users to view, download, and pay invoices directly in the OroCommerce storefront. The feature supports one-click payments for individual invoices.

When the invoice functionality is [enabled in the system configuration](../../../back-office/system/configuration/commerce/sales/global-invoices.md#configuration-guide-commerce-configuration-sales-invoices), you can view customerâ€™s invoices under **My Profile > Invoices** in the storefront.

From the Invoices grid, you can:

* View all invoices and their details, including the total amount and payment status.
* [Filter](../../getting-started/common-controls.md#frontstore-guide-navigation-filters) products by title, invoice number, date, payment status, etc.
* View a specific invoice by opening its view page.
* Pay directly from the grid.
