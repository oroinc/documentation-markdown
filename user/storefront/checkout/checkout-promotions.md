# Use Promotions at Checkout in the Storefront

Customers can redeem coupons that are connected to specific promotions once they reach checkout. Depending on the promotion type, customers can apply one or several coupons to the current order.

To redeem a coupon:

1. Click **I have a Coupon Code** on the bottom left of the **Order Summary** section at the checkout.

3. Click **Apply**.

This way you can apply as many coupons as the conditions of the active promotions allow.

#### NOTE
To delete the coupon code, click <i class="fas fa-trash-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Delete** next to the code.

In addition, any discounts applied to the order will be displayed in the **Total** section of the **Order Summary**.
