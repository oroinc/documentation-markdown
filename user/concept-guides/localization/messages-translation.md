# Translate Labels, Options, and Messages

To translate any UI system element, label, or a popup message, you need to update its translation from within the Translations grid under the **System > Localization > Translations** main menu.

Use the following filters to narrow down the search and locate the element’s key.

* **Languages** — The language in which the label was created.
* **Translated Value** — [Label Name] or its part.
* **English Translation** – Not available. Please note that when a system element is created under a non-English localization, the English translation is absent.
* **Key** — All keys for system elements, labels, or messages end with a *label*. For example, *oro.email.created.label*.
* **Domain** — messages

Once you locate the key, you can use it to translate the label into any selected language using the following filters:

* **Languages** — All (or selected)
* **Key** — [Your Key] e.g., *oro.task.updated_at.label*
