# Translate Content

In the system configuration, you can define the [localization options](../../back-office/system/configuration/system/general-setup/global-localization.md#localization-localization), such as system locale, primary location, address formatting method, system timezone, calendar year settings, temperature and wind speed units on the map. Furthermore, you can set the default language of the UI elements displayed in the storefront.

<!-- begin_content_translation -->

Additionally, you can provide the translation for all the content elements of your storefront (e.g., product names, descriptions, catalog titles, SEO attributes, etc.):

1. Create a necessary [localization](../../back-office/system/localization/localizations/index.md#localization-localizations) under **System > Localization > Localizations**.
2. Add the required localization to the list of enabled localizations under **System > Configuration > System Configuration > General Setup > Localization**. It enables customers to select a desired language of the website content in the storefront.
3. Navigate to the content element you want to provide the translation for.
4. Click the <i class="fas fa-language" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Translations** icon next to the required content element to provide spelling for different languages.
