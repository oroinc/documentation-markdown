# Create and View Comments

Your Oro application enables you to add comments to an activity, such as leaving a comment on a task or a call.

#### IMPORTANT
By default, the list of activities available for each entity is determined by what is most commonly used by businesses. However, if your companyâ€™s work process requires it, you can always turn the desirable activity on for almost any entity (except technical ones). If you need particular activities to be enabled for an entity, contact your administrator, or see steps 4 and 5 in the [Create an Entity](../../system/entities/manage-entities.md#doc-entity-actions-create) action description.

#### NOTE
See a short demo on <a href="https://academy.oroinc.com/media-library/add-comments-orocrm" target="_blank">how to add comments</a>, or keep reading the guidance below.

Once a record or an activity is created, you can add a comment to it from:

- The page of a specific record
- When editing a specific record
- The page of an activity-related record

#### CAUTION
The ability to view and write comments depends on the permissions and role settings defined in the system for the Comment entity.

To add a comment:

1. Click **Add Comment**.
2. Enter the comment into the text box.
3. Click **Choose File** to upload a file to your comment.
4. Click **Add** to save the comment.

#### HINT
You can [edit](../../system/entities/manage-entities.md#doc-entity-actions-edit) the **Comment** entity and add new fields if required.

#### NOTE
Comments for cases have an additional **Make Public** checkbox when your Oro application is integrated with Zendesk. This enables you to make a specific comment public in [Zendesk](../../system/integrations/zendesk-integration.md#user-guide-zendesk-integration).
