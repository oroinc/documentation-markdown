# Search

Search is the fastest way to find a specific record you need. To find a record in OroCommerce/OroCRM:

1. Click the search icon at the top of the screen.
2. Type the search key into the text field.
3. Select the entity which most likely contain the searching record. The search result will then show this entity first in the list.
4. Click **Go** or press *Enter* on the keyboard.

For example, we are searching for “Ann” all over the system:

![Typing Ann in the search bar](user/img/getting_started/navigation/search_ex_1.png)

These are our search results:

![The search result returned 10 records](user/img/getting_started/navigation/search_ex_2.png)

The search returned 10 records, five of which are Orders, three are Products, two are Requests For Quote, three are Accounts, etc. You can scroll through the entire list of results to find the desired record.

If you wait a few seconds before clicking Go, you will see a drop-down list of the most relevant results. If the one you are looking for is in the list, you can immediately click it to open.

If you know you’re looking for a certain account, you can select the Account entity in the search bar. The results will be filtered, displaying Accounts first in the list.

## Search by Tag

To see all the records with a specific tag anywhere in the system, you can search by tag.

![Search the records in tags](user/img/getting_started/navigation/search_vip.png)![Search the records by tag](user/img/getting_started/navigation/search_vip_1.png)

You will see a page that looks similar to the search results and that contains all the records with this tag.
