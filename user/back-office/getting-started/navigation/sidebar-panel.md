# Sidebar Panel

The sidebar panel is a host for a number of widgets that provide fast and convenient access to frequently needed
information, such as recent emails or the task list.

By default, the sidebar panel is located on the right side of the page. However, subject to the configuration settings
of your organization, there can be a sidebar on the left, two sidebars (on the left and on the right), or no sidebar at
all. The location of the sidebar is defined by the system administrator for the whole organization.

## Add a Widget to the Sidebar

Out of the box, any sidebar can contain widgets of three types:

- **Recent Emails** widget: Set up the widget to get access to your emails in one or several of the
  synchronized mailboxes, or to all the emails in your Oro mailbox.
- **Sticky Notes**:  Place free text notes and reminders.
- **Task List**: See the most recent tasks assigned to you.

To add a new widget, use **+**, then select the widget type and click **OK** button.

![Add the widget popup](user/img/getting_started/navigation/sb_select.png)

The newly added widget will appear on the sidebar, below the existing widgets. To reorder widgets on the sidebar, drag
and drop them with your mouse.

You can add more than one widget of any type if necessary. For example, you can stick any amount of notes or follow
several different email folders or mailboxes that are synchronized to your account in the Oro application.

## Expand/Collapse the Sidebar

Initially, the sidebar panel is minimized. Hover over the icon to see the widget header.

In order to expand the sidebar panel, click the <i class="fas fa-arrow-left" aria-hidden="true"></i> arrow at its bottom.

To collapse the panel back, click the <i class="fas fa-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> arrow again.

## Expand/Collapse a Widget

In order to see the widget content:

- Click the icon on a minimized bar.
- Click <i class="fas fa-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> next to the header on the expanded bar.
- Click <i class="fas fa-chevron-down" aria-hidden="true"></i> to fold the widget.

To reorder widgets on the sidebar, drag and drop them with your mouse. This works in both the collapsed and expanded states.

This way, you can keep some of the content visible at all times, and keep fewer used widgets minimized.

## Manage the Widgets

As shown below, each widget contains a header (1), content (2), and icons (3).

![Show header, content, and icons on the widget](user/img/getting_started/navigation/sb_view.png)

You can:

- <i class="fas fa-sync-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i> Refresh the content (e.g., load the most actual emails or tasks).
- <i class="fa fa-cog fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> Configure the widget settings.
- <i class="fas fa-trash-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i> Remove the widget from the sidebar.
- **x** close the widget (appears only when the panel is minimized).

#### HINT
You can add several widgets of the same type and define different settings for them. For example, you can keep notes
with different content, or email widgets for different folders.

## Default Sidebar Widgets

This section describes three sidebar widgets available in the Oro application out-of-the-box.

#### NOTE
You can find more information on dashboard widgets in the corresponding [Dashboard Widgets topic](../../dashboards/dashboards.md#user-guide-business-intelligence-dashboards).

### Recent Emails Sidebar Widget

The widget informs you about new and unread emails and gives you a convenient way to access them.

![The actions you can do with a widget](user/img/getting_started/navigation/sb_emails.png)

From the widget, you can:

- Access the **All Emails** page and see all your emails available in the Oro application (1).
- Mark all the visible emails as read (2).
- Access any of the displayed emails (3).
- Mark any of the displayed emails as read (4).
- Reply, reply all, or forward the emails (5).
- Get to the view page of the user who sent you the email (6).

Click the <i class="fa fa-cog fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> icon to configure the widget.

![Configuration settings of a widget](user/img/getting_started/navigation/sb_emails_set.png)
- Configure the widget to display all the emails from your Oro mailbox, any specific folder, or the mailbox that has been synchronized.
- Change the number of emails displayed.
- Define the default action to be shown if the sidebar panel is expanded.

#### HINT
To make sure you don’t miss some particularly important emails, configure your mailbox to sort them in a specific
folder, then configure the widget to display this folder and place it at the top of your sidebar panel.

### Sticky Note Sidebar Widget

Sticky notes are a great way to keep reminders and memos. You can keep them organized in your Oro sidebar panel.

Click the <i class="fa fa-cog fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> to change the content of a note.

You can keep any number of sticky notes in the panel. If the panel is expanded, you can minimize some of the notes, and keep others visible (such as those that are due today). When you don’t need the note anymore, you can easily delete it.

### Task List Sidebar Widget

This widget displays tasks assigned to you. Tasks are ordered by their due dates in ascending order—the earlier a due date, the higher on the list a task is displayed. Overdue tasks appear in red.

You can perform the following actions with the task list sidebar widget:

* Expand the widget by clicking <i class="fa fa-tasks fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> on the minimized sidebar and <i class="fa fa-caret-right fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> on the maximized sidebar.
* Collapse the widget by clicking <i class="fa fa-times fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> on the minimized sidebar and <i class="fa fa-caret-down fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> on the maximized sidebar.
* Refresh the list of tasks by clicking <i class="fas fa-sync-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i>.
* Configure the parameters for a widget by clicking <i class="fa fa-cog fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i>.
* Change a number of displayed tasks by entering the required value into the **Number of tasks to show** field. Click **OK**.
* Remove the widget from a dashboard by clicking <i class="fas fa-trash-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i>.
