## Add the Calendar of Another User

You can add or remove calendars that you want to watch from the calendar panel on the left. By default, you have **My Tasks** calendar showing your tasks by their due dates, all existing system calendars, and your personal calendar.

To start watching calendars of other users, select a user by clicking **Choose a user to add**.

Use the search field to quickly find the required user: start entering their name and click the required name from the dynamically filtered suggestions. You can also click the hamburger menu next to the list to select the required user in the dialog box using filters, etc.

2. Click the ellipsis menu that appears at the end of the corresponding row, and click to choose the desired color (either from the default color box, or custom color wheel).

## Explore Calendar Event Statuses

Icons within event cells represent invitation statuses depending on whether the invitation has been accepted:

- <i class="fas fa-reply fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Not Responded** — This is the primary status of the invitation. It appears in the following cases:
  - You have not given any response to the invitation.
  - You are the event owner and are not required to respond.
- <i class="fa fa-check fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Accepted** — You have agreed to attend the event (you have responded **Yes** to the event invitation).
- <i class="fa fa-question-circle fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Tentatively Accepted** — You are not sure whether you will attend the event (you have responded **Maybe** to the invitation).
- No icon is displayed in the following cases:
  - You are not going to attend the event and have declined the invitation (you have responded **No** to the event invitation).
  - This is an event from the system calendar.
  - The calendar record represents a task.
- The <i class="far fa-bell" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Reminder** icon appears when the event owner sets up reminders about the event.
