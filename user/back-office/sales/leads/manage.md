### Grid Views

Two grid views are available for leads: **Open Leads** and **All Leads**. Open leads grid view displays the list of all open leads, while all leads grid view displays all existing leads, including the ones that have been disqualified or converted to an opportunity and marked qualified.

### Inline Editing

Inline editing within the grid can help you amend lead details without opening the edit lead form. To edit leads from the grid, double-click on the field or the edit icon in the field you wish to edit.

#### NOTE
Although multiple emails, phones and addresses can be added for leads, only one email, phone and address are displayed in the grid.

## Lead View

The lead page contains all available information on the lead in the **General Information** section and the **Activity** section shows all activity for a lead that has taken place, such as phone calls placed or emails sent to the lead.
