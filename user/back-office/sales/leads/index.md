# Manage Leads in the Back-Office

Leads enabled you to save and process the details of commercial activity with people or businesses that have authority, budget and interest to purchase goods and/or services from you, for whom the probability of actual sales is not yet high or is impossible to define. Essentially, [leads](../../../glossary.md#term-Lead) are prospects or potential sales in a form of contact data. Initial agreement discussions, preliminary price requests or invitations for a bid may be examples of a lead.

<!-- Navigate to **Settings > Configuration** in the main menu. -->

<!-- In the **General Setup** section, check the **Enable Lead** box. -->
<!-- .. note:: Please refer to your administrator if you have insufficient permissions to enable/disable leads in your application. -->

<!-- Use Leads in Workflows------------------------ -->
<!-- You can use Oroâ€™s :term:`workflows <Workflow>` to define rules and guidelines on possible actions/updates of leads in the system. New customer-specific workflows can also be created, as described in the :ref:`Workflows topic <doc--system--workflow-management>`. -->
