# Manage Leads in the Back-Office

Leads enabled you to save and process the details of commercial activity with people or businesses that have authority, budget and interest to purchase goods and/or services from you, for whom the probability of actual sales is not yet high or is impossible to define. Essentially, [leads](../../../glossary.md#term-Lead) are prospects or potential sales in a form of contact data. Initial agreement discussions, preliminary price requests or invitations for a bid may be examples of a lead.
