# Manage Invoices in the Back-Office

The Invoices feature enables customer users to view, download, send to customer, and [pay invoices](../../../storefront/account/invoices/index.md#frontstore-guide-invoices) directly in the OroCommerce storefront. In the back-office, administrators can access and manage invoice records. The feature supports one-click payments for individual invoices.  It also provides the ability to import and manage invoices generated by external systems within the OroCommerce interface.

When the invoice functionality is [enabled in the system configuration](../../system/configuration/commerce/sales/global-invoices.md#configuration-guide-commerce-configuration-sales-invoices), you can view customer’s invoices under **Sales > Invoices** in the main menu.

In the invoices grid, you can open an invoice to view it, or delete it.

On the invoice view page, you can:

* View the invoice details, line items, and payments associated with the invoice.
  > ![Invoices View Page](user/img/sales/invoices/invoices-view-page.png)
* Add a note
* Send an email
* Send the invoice to the customer — To send the invoice to the customer, the invoice must first be posted. Click **Send to Customer** to open the posting confirmation dialog. Keep in mind that once posted, the invoice can no longer be modified. Click **Proceed** to post the invoice and open the email popup dialog with the predefined details of the invoice. The dialog uses the *invoice_notification_template* email template, which you can customize as needed, following the [email templates documentation](../../system/emails/email-templates.md#user-guide-email-template).

* Download the invoice — You can download only the invoices in the *Posted* status. To post the invoice, click the **Send to Customer** button and refresh the page. To download the generated invoice as a .pdf file, click **Download**. Once created, the PDF will not be re-created, even if the invoice is modified later.

As invoices are related to orders, you can access the original order the invoice was generated for. Similarly, you can view invoices associated with the orders on the order view page under the *Invoices* tab.

#### HINT
The ability to pay the invoice in the storefront is controlled by the [Stripe Integration Element](../../system/integrations/payment-integration/stripe/index.md#user-guide-payment-payment-providers-stripe-element) and [OroPay](../../system/integrations/payment-integration/oropay/index.md#user-guide-payment-oropay) in the back-office.
