# Manage Payment Terms in the Back-Office

Use payment terms configured per customer to help them use the payment conditions guaranteed by their contract with your company.

A payment term is a set of conditions required for a sale to be completed, e.g., the period that is allowed for a buyer to pay off the amount due. Payment terms may also include cash in the advance requirement, cash collection on delivery, a deferred payment period of 10/20/30 days, etc.

#### HINT
**To use payment terms in the storefront:**

2. [Create a Payment Term]() with the conditions you would like to offer your buyers.
3. [Link a Payment Term to a Customer Based on Their Sales Agreement]() (optional).
