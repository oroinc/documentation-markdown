# Manage Request for Quotes (RFQ) in the Back-Office

#### HINT
This section is part of the [RFQ and Quote Management](../../../concept-guides/rfq-quotes/index.md#concept-guide-rfq-quotes) topic that provides the general understanding of the RFQ and quote concepts in OroCommerce.

[RFQs (Requests for quotes)](../../../glossary.md#term-Request-for-Quote) are used by sales representatives to assist customers and meet their needs through negotiations on a better price, more convenient quantities of products, or additional services. Once a customer submits a request for quotes in the Oro storefront, it immediately becomes available in the Oro back-office.

Prior to starting your work with RFQs, make sure that you have:

1. **Configured RFQ related workflows** — activate or deactivate the RFQ [workflows](../../system/workflows/system-workflows/index.md#doc-workflows-actions-system) that control the interactions between the storefront and the back-office. These workflows help buyers and sales managers run the process automatically and provide the corresponding status upon this interaction.

2. **Configured RFQ notification options** — [configure RFQ notification options](../../system/configuration/commerce/sales/rfq.md#sys-conf-commerce-sales-rfq-notifications-general) to ensure that both the customers and the sales representatives receive email notifications on submitting a new RFQ.
3. **Configured guest RFQs** — to let unregistered customers request quotes on the items they are interested in, you can enable [guest RFQ forms](../../system/configuration/commerce/sales/rfq.md#user-guide-system-configuration-commerce-sales-rfq) in your Oro application.
