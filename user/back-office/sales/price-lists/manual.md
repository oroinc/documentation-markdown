# Add a Product Price Manually

You can add a product price in the specific currency to the price list manually in one of the following ways:

* While editing a product, in the **Product Prices** section of the product details.
* When viewing the price list details, by clicking **+ Add Product Price**.

#### NOTE
The ability to add product prices from the price list and product pages depends on the *Create* role permission for the Product Price entity. If it is set to *None* for a particular role, adding prices will not be permitted for a user with this role. Please see the [Understand Roles and Permissions](../../system/user-management/roles/index.md#user-guide-user-management-permissions-roles) topic for more details.

4. Select the product to add the price for.
5. Specify the quantity to identify the tier of quantity that the price should apply to.

6. Select the unit of quantity for the price.
7. Type in the price value and select the necessary currency from the list next to it.
