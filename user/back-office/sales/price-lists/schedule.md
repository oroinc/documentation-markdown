# Schedule Price Adjustments

For season sales or any other temporary price amendments, you can create a dedicated price list, configure it to be the highest priority, then enable and disable it on schedule to cover the planned sales time frames.

Scheduled price activation helps eliminate the unwanted pressure of price management during the hot hours and helps you and your salespeople focus on your customers.

To schedule price activation and deactivation:

1. Navigate to **Sales > Price Lists** in the main menu.
2. Click the <i class="fa fa-ellipsis-h fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> **More Options** menu to the right of the required price list and then click the <i class="fa fa-edit fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Edit** icon to start editing price list details.
3. In the **General** section, next to the **Schedule**, add a timetable for price list activation and deactivation:
   1. Click *Choose a date* to open the calendar and pick the date.

   2. Click *time* and select the activation or deactivation time from the list. Alternatively, type it in and press **Enter**.

   3. Click **+ Add** below the timetable to add another slot. Add as many slots as you need.
4. Once you finish adding the activation and deactivation windows, click **Save**.
