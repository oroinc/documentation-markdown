# Add a Shipping Tracking Number to the Order

When a customer user submits an order, they provide the shipping address and, optionally, the *Do Not Ship Later Than* date. They may see the shipping cost estimate based on this information and their selected shipping method. After a salesperson adds the shipping service and their tracking number to the order, the customer user can track the delivery (if the shipping company provides this option).

To add a piece of tracking information about the shipping to the order:

1. Navigate to **Sales > Orders** using the main menu.
2. Click on the necessary order to view its details.
3. Click **Shipping Tracking**.

4. Enter the shipping method (e.g., UPS) and the tracking number.

   Some orders may be delivered in multiple portions due to the circumstances related to the delivery time or delivered volume.

   To provide tracking details for additional shipping, click **+Add** and enter the method and tracking number.
5. Click **Save**.

After the tracking information for shipping has been provided, it becomes available to the buyer in their storefront account in the order information.
