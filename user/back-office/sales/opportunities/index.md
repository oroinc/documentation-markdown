# Manage Opportunities in the Back-Office

[Opportunities](../../../glossary.md#term-Opportunity) are highly probable potential or actual sales to a new or established customer. Request for proposal, invitation for a bidding, agreement of intentions or order for a delivery can be saved as opportunities. These are a universal sales tracking tool that can be related to virtually any customer type.

Similar to leads, opportunities can be enabled or disabled subject to company roles or needs. once enabled, they are added to Sales in the main menu.

In Oro applications, opportunities can either be created from scratch, or converted from related entities, such as leads, customers, or accounts. Various details can be provided for opportunities. For instance, they can be assigned probabilities percentage for each status (e.g. needs analysis, solution development) tailored to the requirements of your business, or given a budget amount in the currency specific to this particular opportunity. Moreover, a sales rep processing an opportunity can track the history of all deals of a particular customer from their opportunity page. This helps compare past and current opportunities, and use this data to manage ongoing projects for each customer. Opportunities can also be viewed on a Kanban board, and managed through multiple workflows.
