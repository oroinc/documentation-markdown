* Delete an opportunity from the system: <i class="fas fa-trash-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i>
* Get to the edit form of the opportunity: <i class="fa fa-edit fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i>
* Get to the view page of the opportunity: <i class="fa fa-eye fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i>

### Inline Editing

[Inline editing](../../getting-started/information-management/manage-records/index.md#doc-grids-actions-records-edit-inline) can help you amend opportunity details without opening the edit opportunity form. For opportunities, it is available from recordsâ€™ grids and view pages.

If the <i class="fas fa-pencil-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Edit Inline** icon appears next to the field, inline editing is available for that value.

To edit the opportunity from the grid, double-click on the field or the inline editing icon <i class="fas fa-pencil-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i> in the field you wish to edit.
