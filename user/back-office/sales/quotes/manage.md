# Manage Quotes

#### HINT
This section is part of the [RFQ and Quote Management](../../../concept-guides/customers-sales/rfq-quotes/index.md#concept-guide-rfq-quotes) topic that provides a general understanding of the RFQ and quote concepts in OroCommerce.

You can edit and delete existing quotes, as well as engage them in various activities, such as [attaching files to a quote](../../getting-started/information-management/attachments.md#user-guide-activities-attachments), [making notes](../../getting-started/information-management/notes.md#user-guide-add-note) on the quote, [creating calendar events](../../activities/calendar-events/index.md#doc-activities-events) linked to the quote, [sending emails](../../getting-started/user-menu/my-emails.md#user-guide-using-emails) related to the quote.
