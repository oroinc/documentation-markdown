# Send a Guest Quote

#### HINT
This section is part of the [RFQ and Quote Management](../../../concept-guides/rfq-quotes/index.md#concept-guide-rfq-quotes) topic that provides the general understanding of the RFQ and quote concepts in OroCommerce.

Non-authenticated customer users can request a quote for the products they are interested in. When the sales representative processes the request and creates a quote in the back-office, buyers can access the quote via a unique direct link through the email.

Once a guest customer user submits an RFQ in the storefront, this RFQ appears in the back-office.

To create a guest quote from the received RFQ:

1. Navigate to **Sales > Requests for Quotes** in the main menu.
2. Click once on the required RFQ to open its page.
3. Click **Create Quote** on the top right.

4. Amend quote details as necessary, and click **Save and Close** once done.
5. The new quote is linked to the original request, which is displayed in the Quote Information section.

6. Click **Send to Customer** on the top right.

   In the displayed form, the template to be applied is by default set to *quote_email_link_guest* and the link to the guest quote is provided in the text body.

7. Click **Send** to email the quote to the buyer.
8. Once the email is sent, the link is displayed in the Quote Information section in the Unique Guest Link field.

   #### NOTE
   The link is added to the Quote Information section only when the quoteâ€™s internal status is transitioned to **Sent to Customer**.
9. To view the quote, click on the link.

   #### NOTE
   If the quote expires, you will no longer be able to submit the quote via the link.

10. When the customer submits the quote and completes the checkout process, you will receive their order details in the back-office.

#### NOTE
The existing quote workflows, their steps and transitions in the back-office work the same way for guest quotes.
