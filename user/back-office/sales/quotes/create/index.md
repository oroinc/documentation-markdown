#### HINT
This section is part of the [RFQ and Quote Management](../../../../concept-guides/rfq-quotes/index.md#concept-guide-rfq-quotes) topic that provides the general understanding of the RFQ and quote concepts in OroCommerce.

You can create a quote based on the customer request for quote, or from scratch, based on the customer interaction outside the Oro application.

* [Create a quote from scratch](create-from-scratch.md#quote-create-from-scratch)
* [Create a quote from an RFQ](create-from-rfq.md#quote-create-from-rfq)

You can create a quote from an open opportunity related to an OroCommerce Customer once you activate the OroCommerce Opportunity Flow:
