# View System Information in the Back-Office

The system information page that is located under **System > System Information** provides a user the list of Oro packages and third-party packages that are installed.

Here, you can check the current versions and licenses of the application you are running, as well as other installed packages. Usually, the page is only used by system administrators and integrators.
