When the workflow is disabled, the workflow transitions are absent from the lead page. Instead, the following action buttons are available:

* **Convert to Opportunity**
* **Disqualify**

Converting a lead into an opportunity means that you are qualifying it as a potential deal. Once the lead is converted into an opportunity, it is marked *Qualified* and is no longer available in the **Open Leads** table.
