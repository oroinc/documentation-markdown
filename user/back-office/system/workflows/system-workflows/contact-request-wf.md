Contact requests are used to track contact with individuals who are requesting information such as product information, support, partnership information, or any other types of assistance. With the help of the Contact Request workflow, you can convert contact requests to opportunities or leads, and resolve them, if necessary. By default, the workflow is active.

#### NOTE
The Contact Request workflow is a system workflow and cannot be edited or deleted.
