# Configure Seller Registration Request Workflow in the Back-Office

#### HINT
This section is part of the [OroMarketplace Concept Guide](../../../../concept-guides/business-models/marketplace/index.md#concept-guide-oro-marketplace) that provides a general understanding of the marketplace features and concepts.

In OroMarketplace, [enabling the seller registration feature](../../configuration/commerce/marketplace/marketplace-general.md#configuration-commerce-marketplace-seller-global) in the system or organization configuration settings, triggers the addition and activation of the Seller Registration Request workflow. It is responsible for adding steps to the seller registration request view page in the marketplace owner organization that help progress the requests of potential vendors to join the marketplace.

#### NOTE
The Seller Registration workflow supports seller requests only from the global organization.
