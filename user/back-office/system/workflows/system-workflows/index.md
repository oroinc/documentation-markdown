# Manage System Workflows in the Back-Office

Since system workflows are pre-implemented in the system, their management from the user interface is limited.

Navigate to **System > Workflows** in the main menu to reach the page with all system workflows.

From the grid, you can perform the following actions for system workflows:

- **View**: <i class="fa fa-eye fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> (Go to the view page of the workflow).
- **Activate/Deactivate**: <i class="fa fa-check fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> / <i class="fa fa-times fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> (activate/deactivate the workflow).
- **Configure**: <i class="fa fa-cog fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i>

#### HINT
In case you need to alter a system workflow, clone it via the command line console under the different name and make the required changes.

<!-- For more information on how to clone a workflow, see :ref:`How to Clone a Workflow <workflows--actions--clone>`. -->
