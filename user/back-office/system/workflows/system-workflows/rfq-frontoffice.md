# Configure RFQ Submission Flow Workflow in the Back-Office

<!-- start_front_flow -->

## Overview

RFQ (Request For Quote) Submission Flow Workflow is a [system workflow](../index.md#user-guide-system-workflow-management-system-custom) that defines the sequence of [steps and transitions](../steps-transitions.md#user-guide-system-workflow-management-steps-transitions) that an RFQ can go through in the storefront and the back-office.

To reach the workflow:

1. Navigate to **System > Workflows** in the main menu.
2. Click **RFQ Submission Flow** to open the flow.

On the RFQ Submission Flow page, you can disable the workflow by clicking <i class="fa fa-times fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Deactivate** the workflow.

## RFQ Customer Statuses

[RFQ Management Flow](rfq-backoffice.md#system-workflows-rfq-backoffice-workflow) and Submission Flow workflows are interconnected. When both workflows are active, the following statuses are available:

<!-- start_customer_statuses -->
1. Customer Statuses (correspond to RFQ Submission Flow on the RFQ page) are the statuses displayed to customers in the storefront. In the back-office, they are visible on the RFQ page:
   > 1. Submitted
   > 2. Pending Approval
   > 3. Requires Attention
   > 4. Cancelled

<!-- stop_customer_statuses -->![image](user/img/system/workflows/rfq/frontoffice/rfq_submission_flow_3.png)
1. Internal Statuses (correspond to RFQ Management Flow) are described in [RFQ Management Flow workflow](rfq-backoffice.md#system-workflows-rfq-backoffice-workflow).

#### NOTE
Neither customer nor internal statuses can be edited or deleted.

Statuses are also displayed in the RFQ list:

The following table describes which options are available for each of the statuses, and how the corresponding transitions change them.

## Sample Flow

As an illustration, let us go through a sample flow to see RFQ Submission Flow in action:

1. A customer user creates an RFQ in the storefront. Once the RFQ is sent, its customer status is marked as Submitted.
   ![image](user/img/system/workflows/rfq/frontoffice/rfq_submission_flow_3.png)
2. In the back-office, a sales representative sees the RFQ and requests more information. The RFQ is now in the Requires Attention customer status.
   ![image](user/img/system/workflows/rfq/frontoffice/rfq_submission_flow_6.png)
3. The customer user receives the request in the storefront, clicks Provide Information in the right corner of the page and replies to the message. The customer status is now Submitted.
   ![image](user/img/system/workflows/rfq/frontoffice/RFQProvideInfo.png)![image](user/img/system/workflows/rfq/frontoffice/RFQInformationProvided.png)
4. The sales representative reads the reply in the Notes section of the RFQ page, marks the RFQ processed and creates a quote from the same page. The RFQ is now in the Processed customer status.
