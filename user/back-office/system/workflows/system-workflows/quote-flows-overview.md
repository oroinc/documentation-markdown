#### NOTE
For general information on using workflows, see the [Workflows](../index.md#user-guide-system-workflow-management) section.

Quote workflows lead a sales person through the process of gaining agreement with a buyer on a quote. Backoffice workflows control the actions available in the back-office.

Out-of-the-box, OroCommerce supports two mutually exclusive quote management workflows:

* [Quote Management Flow](backoffice-quote-flow-with-approvals.md#system-workflows-quote-backoffice-workflow) — A simple quote management flow, where a sales person is not bound by any limitations and can handle the sale without supervision.
* [Backoffice Quote Flow with Approvals](backoffice-quote-flow-with-approvals.md#doc-workflows-backoffice-quote-flow-with-approvals) — A flow, where a sales person might have to get approval from the authorized person (e.g. their manager) before sending the quote with updated prices to the buyer.

#### WARNING
Approval is not requested when the **Price Override Requires Approval** option is disabled in the workflow configuration. In this case, both workflows follow the simple quote management flow, with no approvals. See the [Enable Approvals in Workflow Configuration](backoffice-quote-flow-with-approvals.md#doc-workflows-backoffice-quote-flow-with-approvals-configure) section for more information on how to enable approvals.
