# Manage Custom Workflows in the Back-Office

Workflows created on the UI from scratch are custom workflows.
Navigate to **System > Workflows** in the main menu to reach the page with all custom and system workflows.
You can perform the following actions for them:

- **Clone**: <i class="far fa-copy" aria-hidden="true"></i> (copy the workflow to be able to customize it).
- **View**: <i class="fa fa-eye fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> (go to the view page of the workflow).
- **Activate/Deactivate**: <i class="fa fa-check fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> / <i class="fa fa-times fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> (activate/deactivate the workflow).
- **Edit**: <i class="fa fa-edit fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> (open the edit form of the workflow).
- **Delete**: <i class="fas fa-trash-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i> (delete the workflow from the system).
