# Configure Global Address Validation Settings

#### NOTE
The Address Validation feature can be configured on the global, [organization](../../../user-management/organizations/org-configuration/commerce/shipping/address-validation-org.md#organization-commerce-configuration-shipping-address-validation), and [website](../../../websites/web-configuration/commerce/shipping/address-validation-website.md#website-commerce-configuration-shipping-address-validation) levels.

The Address Validation feature ensures that user-entered shipping or billing addresses are accurate, recognized by the shipping service, and can be used for precise shipping cost estimation.

When a customer or admin user enters a new address, the system validates it through an external address validation service (UPS or FedEx) and provides suggestions if needed. If the entered address is valid, no changes are required, and no popup is triggered. If the service suggests corrections, the user is asked to choose an address:

* **1 to 3 suggestions**: Each is displayed as a radio button, with the first *suggested address* selected by default. The changes are highlighted in the storefront and underlined in the back-office.

* **More than 3 suggestions**: The original address and a *suggested address* radio button are displayed, while all suggested addresses appear in a dropdown. The first suggested address is pre-selected. The changes are highlighted in the storefront and underlined in the back-office.

* **Update or save an adjusted shipping or billing address**: Users also have the possibility to update or save an adjusted address. In the validation popup, alongside address suggestions, the **Update Address** or **Save Address** options may be available. **Update Address** allows the system to automatically apply the corrected address throughout the system where it is used. **Save Address** allows to save the adjusted address as a new address in the system.

## Prerequisites

Before you enable the address validation feature, ensure that you have properly configured either [UPS](../../../integrations/shipping-integration/ups.md#doc-integrations-ups) or [FedEx](../../../integrations/shipping-integration/fedex.md#doc-integrations-fedex) shipping integration for your application.

#### IMPORTANT
When testing the Address Validation feature using a **UPS account in test mode**, only addresses from New York (NY) and California (CA) will provide validation results. The validation is based on the **ZIP code**, rather than the state field. This limitation is specific to UPSâ€™s test mode and does not affect production behavior.

## Configuration

To enable the address validation feature:

1. Navigate to **System > Configuration** in the main menu.
2. Select **Commerce > Shipping > Address Validation** in the menu to the left.

   #### NOTE
   For faster navigation between the configuration menu sections, use [Quick Search](../../quick-search.md#user-guide-system-configuration-quick-search).
3. Under the **General** section, select a shipping service whose databases will be used to verify the entered shipping or billing addresses in real-time (clear the **Use Default** checkbox to customize the settings).
4. Save the settings for additional options to appear.
5. Under the **Storefront** section, select the places where address validation should be triggered in the storefront, such as under **My Account > Address Book** menu when adding or modifying a billing or shipping address, or during checkout. By default, the system validates only shipping addresses.

6. Under the **Back-Office** section, select the places where address validation should be triggered in the back-office, such as:
   * under the **Customers** menu when adding or modifying a billing or shipping address for a customer or customer user
   * under **Sales > Orders** when adding or modifying a billing or shipping address for the order receiver
   * under **Sales > Quotes** when adding or modifying a shipping address for the quote receiver

By default, the system validates only shipping addresses.
