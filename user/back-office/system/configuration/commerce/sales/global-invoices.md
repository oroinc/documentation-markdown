# Configure Global Invoice Settings

The Invoices feature enables customer users to view, download, and [pay invoices](../../../../../storefront/account/invoices/index.md#frontstore-guide-invoices) directly in the OroCommerce storefront. In the back-office, administrators can access and manage invoice records. The feature supports one-click payments for individual invoices. It also provides the ability to import and manage invoices generated by external systems within the OroCommerce interface.

You can configure invoice-related sales globally, per [organization](../../../user-management/organizations/org-configuration/commerce/sales/organization-invoices.md#user-guide-system-configuration-commerce-sales-invoices-org), [website](../../../websites/web-configuration/commerce/sales/website-invoices.md#user-guide-system-configuration-commerce-sales-invoices-per-website), [customer group](../../../../customers/customer-groups/customer-group-configuration/commerce/sales/customer-group-invoices-settings.md#user-guide-customer-group-invoice-settings) and [customer](../../../../customers/customers/customer-configuration/commerce/sales/customer-invoices-settings.md#user-guide-customers-invoice-settings).

1. Navigate to **System > Configuration** in the main menu.
2. Select **Commerce > Sales > Invoices** in the menu to the left.

   #### NOTE
   For faster navigation between the configuration menu sections, use [Quick Search](../../quick-search.md#user-guide-system-configuration-quick-search).
