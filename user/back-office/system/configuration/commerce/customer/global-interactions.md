# Configure Global Interactions Settings

The Interactions settings allow you to interact with your customer users, enabling conversations between back-office users and customer users, ensuring a smooth and compliant user experience.

#### NOTE
The conversations feature is available as of OroCommerce version 6.0.4 as a <a href="https://extensions.oroinc.com/orocommerce/extension/oro-conversations/" target="_blank">Conversations extension</a>, which you can download from the Oro Extensions Store. Next, use the composer to [install it on your application](../../../../../../backend/extension/install-extension.md#cookbook-extensions-composer).

To enable the conversations feature:

1. Navigate to **System > Configuration** in the main menu.
2. Select **Commerce > Customer > Interactions** in the menu to the left.

   #### NOTE
   For faster navigation between the configuration menu sections, use [Quick Search](../../quick-search.md#user-guide-system-configuration-quick-search).

4. Toggle the **Enable Conversations** checkbox to activate or deactivate the feature.
5. Click **Save Settings**.

Enabling conversations adds the [Conversations](../../../../activities/conversations/index.md#doc-activities-conversations) menu under **Activities**.
