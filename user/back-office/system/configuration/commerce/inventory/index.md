#### HINT
This section is part of the [Inventory and Warehouse Management](../../../../../concept-guides/inventory/index.md#concept-guide-inventory) topic that provides a general understanding of the inventory and warehouse concepts.

Discover how to configure your storefront and back-office inventory statuses, add warehouses, manage product inventory options, set inventory thresholds and quantity limitations. You can control the way inventory is managed in OroCommerce on several levels â€“ globally, [per organization](../../../user-management/organizations/org-configuration/commerce/inventory/index.md#configuration-commerce-inventory-organization), [per website](../../../websites/web-configuration/commerce/inventory/index.md#configuration-commerce-inventory-website), [per product](../../../../products/products/create-simple.md#create-simple-product-inventory), and [per master catalog category](../../../../products/master-catalog/index.md#master-catalog-inventory).
