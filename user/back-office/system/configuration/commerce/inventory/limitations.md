# Configure Global Inventory Quantity Limitations Settings

#### HINT
This section is part of the [Inventory and Warehouse Management](../../../../../concept-guides/catalog-promotions/inventory/index.md#concept-guide-inventory) topic that provides a general understanding of the inventory and warehouse concepts.

You can control the minimum and maximum quantities that are available buyers (in the storefront) and sales people (in the back-office) can claim in the RFQ, customer order, quote, or a shopping list.

To change the default inventory quantity limitations:

1. Navigate to **System > Configuration** in the main menu.
2. Select **Commerce > Inventory > Limitations** in the menu to the left.

   #### NOTE
   For faster navigation between the configuration menu sections, use [Quick Search](../../quick-search.md#user-guide-system-configuration-quick-search).
