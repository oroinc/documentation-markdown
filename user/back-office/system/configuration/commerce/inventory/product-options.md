# Configure Global Product Options Settings

#### HINT
This section is part of the [Inventory and Warehouse Management](../../../../../concept-guides/inventory/index.md#concept-guide-inventory) topic that provides the general understanding of the inventory and warehouse concepts.

You can control the way product inventory is managed for every product in the OroCommerce product catalog on multiple levels â€“ globally, [per organization](../../../user-management/organizations/org-configuration/commerce/inventory/organization-product-options.md#sys-conf-commerce-inventory-product-options-organization), [per website](../../../websites/web-configuration/commerce/inventory/website-product-options.md#sys-conf-commerce-inventory-product-options-website), [per product](../../../../products/products/create-simple.md#create-simple-product-inventory), and [per master catalog category](../../../../products/master-catalog/index.md#master-catalog-inventory).

To customize the default product options globally:

1. Navigate to **System > Configuration** in the main menu.
2. Select **Commerce > Inventory > Product Options** in the menu to the left.

   #### NOTE
   For faster navigation between the configuration menu sections, use [Quick Search](../../quick-search.md#user-guide-system-configuration-quick-search).

Here, you can manage both inventory and upcoming products options.

> | **Managed Inventory**       | This options indicates whether the product inventory is handled by OroCommerce vs external application.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
> | **Inventory Threshold**     | A minimum quantity of the product that is treated as *In stock*. When a product quantity reaches this threshold value, the product inventory status falls back to *Out Of Stock*.                                                                                                                                                      |
> | **Backorders**              | A flag that indicates whether OroCommerce accepts backorders (available for the Enterprise edition only).

> | **Decrement Inventory**     | A flag that indicates whether OroCommerce decrements inventory upon order. When both **Decrement Inventory** and **Backorders** are enabled, product quantity may get negative.                                                                                                                                                        |
> | **Highlight Low Inventory** | This option indicates whether wholesale buyers are able to see that there might not be enough product left in stock for their purchase.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
