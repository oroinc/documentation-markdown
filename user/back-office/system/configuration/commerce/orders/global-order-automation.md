# Configure Global Order Automation Settings

You can set all orders with selected internal statuses to be automatically cancelled past their “Do Not Ship Later Than” date.

#### HINT
You can enable/disable automatic order cancellation globally and [per organization](../../../user-management/organizations/org-configuration/commerce/orders/organization-order-automation.md#configuration-commerce-orders-order-automation-organization).

To configure automatic order cancellation globally:

1. Navigate to **System > Configuration** in the main menu.
2. Select **Commerce > Orders > Order Automation** in the menu to the left.

#### NOTE
For faster navigation between the configuration menu sections, use [Quick Search](../../quick-search.md#user-guide-system-configuration-quick-search).

1. In the **Order Automation** section:
   1. Clear the **Use System** checkbox.
   2. Select the **Enable Automatic Order Cancellation** checkbox.
