# Configure Global Website Access Settings

<!-- begin -->

#### HINT
This section is part of the [Guest Functions](../../../../../concept-guides/administration/guests/index.md#sys-conf-commerce-guest) topic that provides a general understanding of the guest access concept in OroCommerce.

To prevent non-registered customers from accessing the OroCommerce storefront, you can disable website access by non-authenticated visitors. This can be done globally, [per organization](../../../user-management/organizations/org-configuration/commerce/guests/organization-guest-access.md#sys-conf-commerce-guest-access-org) and [per website](../../../websites/web-configuration/commerce/guests/website-guest-access.md#sys-conf-commerce-guest-access-website):

When guest access is disabled:

* New users can register if self-registration is enabled in **Commerce > Customer > Customer Users > Registration Allowed**.
* Guest users can register if self-registration is allowed, even if the website access is closed.
* Guest users cannot access any website pages, except for the login/forgot/reset password page.
* Guest users are redirected to the login page when they try to access the homepage.
