# Configure Global Shipping Tax Settings

#### HINT
This section is part of the [Tax Management](../../../../../concept-guides/taxes/index.md#concept-guide-taxes) concept guide that provides the general understanding of the tax configuration and management in OroCommerce.

You can select a shipping tax code that should be used for shipping total cost calculation and specify if the shipping cost already contains a tax.

To change the shipping tax configuration:

1. Navigate to the system configuration (click **System > Configuration** in the main menu).
2. Select **Commerce > Taxation > Shipping** in the menu to the left.

   #### NOTE
   For faster navigation between the configuration menu sections, use [Quick Search](../../quick-search.md#user-guide-system-configuration-quick-search).

   The following options are available on the page:
   * Tax Code - a tax identifier that in combination with [tax rules](../../../../taxes/tax-rules/index.md#tax-rules) defines the tax rate that is applied for the shipping tax calculation.
   * Shipping Rates Include Tax - select the box to avoid adding the calculated shipping tax to the shipping cost.
3. To customize any of these options:
   > 1. Clear the **Use Default** box next to the option.
   > 2. Modify the tax code list: click **x** to remove the item, type in the new code value and press **Enter**.
   > 3. Select/deselect the **Shipping Rates Include Tax** option.
4. Click **Save**.
