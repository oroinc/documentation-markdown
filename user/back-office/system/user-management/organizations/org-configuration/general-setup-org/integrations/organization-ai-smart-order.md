This section is part of the [AI and Automation Concept Guide](../../../../../../../concept-guides/ai/index.md#concept-guide-ai) topic that provides an overview of OroCommerceâ€™s AI-powered tools AI Smart Agent and AI Smart Order.

AI Smart Order is available for OroCommerce Enterprise and is aimed at simplifying the process of handling purchase orders. With AI Smart Order feature that includes a [dashboard widget](../../../../../../dashboards/widgets/ai-smart-order.md#user-guide-dashboards-widgets) and [an email automation](../../../../../../sales/orders/create.md#user-guide-sales-orders-create-from-ai-smart-order), you can have emailed PDFs and other document types converted directly into draft orders in your OroCommerce application.

1. Navigate to **System > User Management > Organizations** in the main menu.
2. For the necessary organization, hover over the <i class="fa fa-ellipsis-h fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> **More Options** menu at the end of the row and click <i class="fas fa-cog" aria-hidden="true"></i> to start editing the configuration.
3. Click **System Configuration > Integrations > AI Smart Order** in the menu to the left.
4. In the **AI Smart Order** section, clear the **Use System** checkbox and select the **Enable AI Smart Order** checkbox to enable the feature in the storefront.
