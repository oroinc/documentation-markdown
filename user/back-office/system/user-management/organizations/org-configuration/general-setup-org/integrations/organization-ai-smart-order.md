This section is part of the [AI and Automation Concept Guide](../../../../../../../concept-guides/ai/index.md#concept-guide-ai) topic that provides an overview of OroCommerce’s AI-powered tools AI Smart Agent and AI Smart Order.

AI Smart Order is available for OroCommerce Enterprise and is aimed at simplifying the process of handling purchase orders. With AI Smart Order feature that includes a [dashboard widget](../../../../../../dashboards/widgets/ai-smart-order.md#user-guide-dashboards-widgets) and [an email automation](../../../../../../sales/orders/create.md#user-guide-sales-orders-create-from-ai-smart-order), you can have emailed PDFs and other document types converted directly into draft orders in your OroCommerce application.

To enable this feature per organization:

1. Navigate to **System > User Management > Organizations** in the main menu.
2. For the necessary organization, hover over the <i class="fa fa-ellipsis-h fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> **More Options** menu at the end of the row and click <i class="fas fa-cog" aria-hidden="true"></i> to start editing the configuration.
3. Click **System Configuration > Integrations > AI Smart Order** in the menu to the left.
4. 1. To manage any of the available options, clear the **Use System** next to them first.
5. In the **AI Smart Order** section, select the **Enable AI Smart Order** checkbox to enable the feature in the storefront.
6. If you have a <a href="https://extensions.oroinc.com/orocommerce/extension/customer-part-number/" target="_blank">Customer Part Number</a> extension installed, select the **Use CPN in Smart Order** check box to allow customer part numbers to be used and managed for line items during [smart order draft creation](../../../../../../dashboards/widgets/ai-smart-order.md#user-guide-dashboards-widgets). Please make sure that the **Customer Part Number** [feature is enabled](../../../../../configuration/commerce/product/global-customer-settings.md#sys-commerce-product-customer-settings) under **System > Commerce > Product > Customer Settings**.
7. Click **Save Settings**.
