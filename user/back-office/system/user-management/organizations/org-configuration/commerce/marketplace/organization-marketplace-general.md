# Configure Marketplace Settings per Organization

#### HINT
This section is part of the [OroMarketplace Concept Guide](../../../../../../../concept-guides/business-models/marketplace/index.md#concept-guide-oro-marketplace) that provides a general understanding of the marketplace features and concepts.

In OroMarketplace, you can configure to allow sellers to create products in their organization.

#### NOTE
You can also configure marketplace settings [globally](../../../../../configuration/commerce/marketplace/marketplace-general.md#configuration-commerce-marketplace-seller-global).

To configure marketplace settings per organization:

1. Navigate to **System > User Management > Organizations** in the main menu.
2. For the necessary organization, hover over the <i class="fa fa-ellipsis-h fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> **More Options** menu to the right of the necessary organization and click <i class="fas fa-cog" aria-hidden="true"></i> to start editing the configuration.
3. Select **Commerce > Marketplace > General** in the menu to the left.

#### NOTE
For faster navigation between the configuration menu sections, use [Quick Search](../../../../../configuration/quick-search.md#user-guide-system-configuration-quick-search).
