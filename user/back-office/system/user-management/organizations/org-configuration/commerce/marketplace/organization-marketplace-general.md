# Configure Marketplace Settings per Organization

#### HINT
This section is part of the [OroMarketplace Concept Guide](../../../../../../../concept-guides/business-models/marketplace/index.md#concept-guide-oro-marketplace) that provides a general understanding of the marketplace features and concepts.

In OroMarketplace, you can enable seller registration (global organization only) and allow sellers to create products in their organization(s).

#### NOTE
You can also configure marketplace settings [globally](../../../../../configuration/commerce/marketplace/marketplace-general.md#configuration-commerce-marketplace-seller-global).

To configure marketplace settings per organization:

1. Navigate to **System > User Management > Organizations** in the main menu.
2. For the necessary organization, hover over the <i class="fa fa-ellipsis-h fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> **More Options** menu to the right of the necessary organization and click <i class="fas fa-cog" aria-hidden="true"></i> to start editing the configuration.
3. Select **Commerce > Marketplace > General** in the menu to the left.

#### NOTE
For faster navigation between the configuration menu sections, use [Quick Search](../../../../../configuration/quick-search.md#user-guide-system-configuration-quick-search).

1. In the **Products** section, enable or disable the ability for the sellers to create products in their (seller) organization. This option is enabled by default.
2. In the **Seller Registration** section:
   * Select the **Enable Seller Registration** checkbox to activate the ability for sellers to register with your marketplace online.

   #### IMPORTANT
   This option can be ebabled only in the organization settings of the global organization.

   When registration is enabled, you can select the owner of the sellerâ€™s request and select the [consents](../../../../../../../concept-guides/administration/consents/index.md#user-guide-consents) to be displayed in the Seller Registration form in the storefront website. Enabling this option also adds the [Seller Registration workflow](../../../../../workflows/system-workflows/seller-registration-flow.md#system-workflows-seller-registration-flow) to the list of workflows under **System > Workflows**.
