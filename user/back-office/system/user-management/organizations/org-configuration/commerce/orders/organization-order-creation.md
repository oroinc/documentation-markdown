# Configure Order Creation Settings per Organization

To configure the [order](../../../../../../../glossary.md#term-Order) creation options per organization:

1. Navigate to **System > User Management > Organizations** in the main menu.
2. For the necessary organization, hover over the <i class="fa fa-ellipsis-h fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> **More Options** menu at the end of the row and click <i class="fas fa-cog" aria-hidden="true"></i> to start editing the configuration.

   #### NOTE
   For faster navigation between the configuration menu sections, use [Quick Search](../../../../../configuration/quick-search.md#user-guide-system-configuration-quick-search).
3. In the **Order Creation** section:
   1. Clear the **Use System** checkbox if it is selected.
   2. From the **New Internal Order Status** list, select the required status. This option defines the [status](../../../../../../sales/orders/statuses.md#doc-orders-statuses-internal) that is assigned to an order upon creation. This status is visible in the back-office. Select one of the following statuses: Open, Cancelled, Shipped, Closed, Archived.
4. Click **Save Settings**.
