# Configure Settings for Contacts per Organization (Sales Rep Information)

To enable or disable the display of sales representative information in the storefront [footer links](../../../../../../../storefront/getting-started/general-layout.md#frontstore-guide-navigation-footer) per organization:

1. Navigate to **System > User Management > Organizations** in the main menu.
2. For the necessary organization, hover over the <i class="fa fa-ellipsis-h fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> **More Options** menu to the right of the necessary organization and click <i class="fas fa-cog" aria-hidden="true"></i> to start editing the configuration.
3. Select **Commerce > Sales > Contacts** in the menu to the left.

   #### NOTE
   For faster navigation between the configuration menu sections, use [Quick Search](../../../../../configuration/quick-search.md#user-guide-system-configuration-quick-search).
4. In the **Display** list, select one of the options that will determine what and whose information to show on the website.
   * **Don’t Display Contact Info** - no sales rep information is displayed. This option is the default one.
   * **Customer User Owner** - allow customer user owner information to be displayed.
   * **Customer Owner** - allow customer owner information to be displayed.

     #### NOTE
     User settings override all other settings if **Customer Owner** or **Customer User Owner** are selected as a display option.
   * **Pre-configured** - in the *Contact Details* text field, specify custom contact details you wish to be displayed.

   Such organization settings override settings set on the [system level](../../../../../configuration/commerce/sales/contacts.md#sys-conf-commerce-sales-contacts-global) unless **Use System** checkbox is enabled.
5. Options selected as **Available User Options** determine what options the user will see in the **Customer Visible Contact Info** list in their user configuration settings (in **My User > My Configuration > Commerce > Sales > Contacts > Customer Visible Contact Info**).

   The options are the following:
   * **Don’t Display Contact Info** – allow setting the option of no sales rep information to be displayed.
   * **Use User Profile Data** – allow setting the option of user profile details to be displayed.
   * **Enter Manually** – allow to set the option of manually entered text in the *Enter Contact Info* field.

   Such organization settings override settings set at the [system level](../../../../../configuration/commerce/sales/contacts.md#sys-conf-commerce-sales-contacts-global) unless **Use System** checkbox is enabled.
6. In the **Guest Contact** text box, you may enter contact information that will be shown to non-authenticated visitors. Click **Use System** to use the text configured at the system level.
7. Click **Save Settings**.
