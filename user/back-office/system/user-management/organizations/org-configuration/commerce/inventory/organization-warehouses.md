# Configure Warehouse Settings per Organization

#### NOTE
The ability to configure warehouses is only available in the Enterprise edition.

To enable and prioritize warehouses per organization:

1. Navigate to **System > User Management > Organizations** in the main menu.
2. For the necessary organization, hover over the <i class="fa fa-ellipsis-h fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> **More Options** menu to the right of the necessary organization and click <i class="fas fa-cog" aria-hidden="true"></i> to start editing the configuration.
3. Select **Commerce > Inventory > Warehouses** in the menu to the left.

   #### NOTE
   For faster navigation between the configuration menu sections, use [Quick Search](../../../../../configuration/quick-search.md#user-guide-system-configuration-quick-search).
4. Enable as many warehouses as you need:
   > 1. If necessary, click **+Add Warehouse**.
   > 2. Select the warehouse name in the *Choose a Warehouse* list.
   > 3. Assign a numeric priority to the enabled warehouse (1 is higher, 100 is lower).
   >    Products will be ordered and shipped from the higher priority warehouses first.

#### NOTE
You can manage the list of enabled warehouses using the following actions:

* To disable a warehouse, click **x** to the right of the priority.
* To clear the selected warehouse, click **x** to the right of the warehouse name.
* To select different warehouse from the list, click **v** to the right of the warehouse name, and select a new warehouse to enable.
* To see the complete list of the warehouses in a table view, click **bars** sign to the right of the warehouse name. The list of warehouses opens in a popup window.

1. Once all warehouses are enabled and prioritized, click **Save Settings**.
