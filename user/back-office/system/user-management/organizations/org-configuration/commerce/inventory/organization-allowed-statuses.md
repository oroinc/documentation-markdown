# Configure Allowed Inventory Statuses Settings per Organization

You can allow storefront users to filter products by the Inventory statuses, while allowing administrators to prevent revealing unwanted inventory details in the storefront.

> #### HINT
> This configuration is also available on the [global](../../../../../configuration/commerce/inventory/allowed-statuses.md#configuration-guide-commerce-configuration-inventory-allowed-statuses) and [website](../../../../../websites/web-configuration/commerce/inventory/website-allowed-statuses.md#allowed-statuses-website) levels.

To change the default inventory filter settings per organization:

1. Navigate to **System > User Management > Organizations** in the main menu.
2. For the necessary organization, hover over the <i class="fa fa-ellipsis-h fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> **More Options** menu to the right of the necessary organization and click <i class="fas fa-cog" aria-hidden="true"></i> to start editing the configuration.
3. Select **Commerce > Inventory > Allowed Statuses** in the menu to the left.

   #### NOTE
   For faster navigation between the configuration menu sections, use [Quick Search](../../../../../configuration/quick-search.md#user-guide-system-configuration-quick-search).
4. Customize any of the options by clearing the **Use System** box next to the following options:
   * **Enable For Guests** - enable or disable the ability to show the inventory filter to unauthenticated visitors.
   * **Inventory Filter Type** - select the type of inventory filter to display. The *Multi-Select* filter type enables users to filter by any combination of individual inventory statuses. The *Simple* type will allow to filter only by predefined inventory statuses when the filter is applied. For this type, select the statuses that will be considered as *In Stock* in the storefront in the *In Stock Statuses For Simple Filter* field below.
5. Click **Save Settings**.
