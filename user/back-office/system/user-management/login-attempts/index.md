# Login Attempts

To simplify investigation of any security-related incidents, the administrator can check the successful and unsuccessful
login attempts.

The login info data is stored in the database and in the logs in the **security** log channel. The logs have the ID parameter used in the database to enable you to find a particular log item quickly.

The list of all login attempts is available under **System > User Management > Login Attempts** in the main back-office menu.

The administrator can also open this list directly from the customer user view page by clicking on the link with the date of the  last login:

![Link to Login Attempts on View Page](user/img/system/user_management/login_attempts/user_view_page.png)

In this case, the data in datagrid will be filtered by this user:

<!-- Ic Tiles is used as Set As Default in saved views, and as tiles in display layout options -->

<!-- Check mark in the square. -->
<!-- SortDesc is also used as drop-down arrow -->
