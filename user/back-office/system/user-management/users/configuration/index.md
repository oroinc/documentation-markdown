# Configure User System Settings

You can configure available system settings on four [configuration levels](../../../index.md#configuration-guide-config-levels): system, organization, website, and user.

On user level, there are a number of options that you can configure specifically for yourself or for another user, but which will not affect system-wide or organization-wide configuration. Here, for instance, you can update the contact information of the primary assigned sales representative, or change your email configuration settings.

#### IMPORTANT
User-level configuration settings can fall back to [organization settings](../../organizations/org-configuration/index.md#doc-organization-configuration). For this, select the **Use Organization** checkbox next to the selected option. To go back to the default user-level settings, click **Reset** on the top right.

Two categories of settings are available for configuration at user level:

* System Configuration (General Setup, Integrations)
* Commerce (Sales)

More information about the options available for each of the two categories is available below.
