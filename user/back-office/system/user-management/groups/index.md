# Configure User Groups in the Back-Office

A user group is a set of users for convenience consolidated by one or more parameters. User groups are used in the notification rules and filters.

To create a user group:

1. Navigate to **System > User Management > Groups** in the main menu.
2. Click **Create Group** on the top right.

3. In the **General** section, provide the following information:
   * **Owner** — The group owner represents a business unit whose members can manage the group subject to the [access and permission settings](../roles/index.md#user-guide-user-management-permissions).
   * **Name** — The name used to refer to the user group on the interface.
4. In the **Users** section, select the **Has Group** check box next to the required users to add them to the group you are creating.

   #### NOTE
   One user can belong to more than one group.
5. Click **Save and Close**.

Once saved, the group is available on the list of all groups under **System > User Management > Groups**, where you can filter groups by name, edit and delete them.
