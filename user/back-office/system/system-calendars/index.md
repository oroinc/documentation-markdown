# Configure System Calendars in the Back-Office

In your Oro application, you can add calendars with tasks and events related to a specific user, other users in the system
(subject to the [roles and permissions defined](../user-management/roles/index.md#user-guide-user-management-permissions)), as well as events
defined for the whole organization or system.

Events in the system and organization calendars can be viewed by all the users within the system/organization.
The ability to create, edit, and delete events depends on the user’s [roles](../user-management/roles/index.md#user-guide-user-management-permissions) and [capabilities](../user-management/roles/admin-capabilities.md#admin-capabilities-org-calendar-events).

## Create System and Organization Calendars

You can create as many calendars as you need under the System menu in your Oro application.

To create a system or an organization calendar:

1. Navigate to **System > System Calendars** in the main menu.
2. Click **Create System Calendar**.
3. In the creation page, define the following fields:
   * **Calendar Name** — This is the only mandatory field. Defines the name used to refer to the calendar in the system.
   * **Color** — Choose the color used to highlight events in the calendar by default.
   * **Scope** — Define if this is a system or organization calendar (meaningful for the Enterprise edition only).

## Add Events to a System Calendar

You can add event to system calendars in two ways:

* From the page of the [system calendar](../../activities/calendar-events/create-calendar-event.md#user-guide-activities-events-add-system-calendar) under **System > System Calendars**.
* From [My Calendar](../../activities/calendar-events/create-calendar-event.md#user-guide-activities-events-add-my-calendar) under your user name on the top right.

You can find detailed information on adding calendar events to user calendars in the [Calendar Events](../../activities/calendar-events/create-calendar-event.md#doc-activities-events-actions-add) topic.
