# Configure Translations in the Back-Office

#### HINT
This section is part of the [Localization and Translation](../../../../concept-guides/administration/localization/index.md#concept-guide-localization-translation) concept guide that provides a general understanding of the localization and translation processes in OroCommerce.

<!-- begin -->

Translations are a collection of visual elements in the Oro application, like labels, information massages, notifications, alerts, workflow statuses, etc.

To add or edit the text translated to the target language, navigate to **System > Localization > Translations** in the main menu.

The following information about the translations is available in the All Translations list:

| Name                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| LANGUAGE            | The language of the text system elements available to the user.                                                                                                                                                    |
| TRANSLATED          | The status indicates whether the text items are translated to the target language (Yes/No).                                                                                                                        |
| ENGLISH TRANSLATION | The column contains the english translation of the text items.                                                                                                                                                     |
| TRANSLATED VALUE    | The translation value of the text item to the target language.                                                                                                                                                     |
| CURRENT VALUE       | The translation of the system element currently displayed to the user on the UI of the Oro application.                                                                                                            |
| KEY                 | A coded text string that identifies the text system element and is used to find its translation to the target language<br/>(e.g. oro.ui.updated_at) in Oro applications.                                           |
| DOMAIN              | The logical affiliation to a particular functionality that organises linguistic sources by domain (e.g. security, entities<br/>jsmessages, maintenance, install, workflows, messages, validators, HWIOAuthBundle). |
| CONTEXT             | The detailed location of the translated functional component (e.g., Workflow “Checkout” -> Name).                                                                                                                  |

#### IMPORTANT
Remember a rule of thumb:

The translations which are currently displayed to the user in the Oro application are located in the **Current value** column. This column inherits the values from the **Translated value** column upon update. If there is no translation provided for a specific language, the **Current value** column is populated with the default English translation mentioned in the **English translation** column. If the system element doesn’t have the English equivalent, the **Current value** column takes the value from the **Key** column.

#### NOTE
Presence of a high number of custom translations affects website performance. To avoid this, consider
moving these translations to the source code, as described in the [developer documentation](../../../../../backend/translations/translations-add-to-source-code.md#dev-translation-add-to-source-code).

## Verify Translations

View and check the validity of all the available UI element translations. Use search and filters to help find the necessary text element.

## Update Translated Value

Add a translation to any UI element or update the existing one by proceeding a few steps:

> 1. Double-click the cell in the **Translated Value** column.
> 2. Type in the translation of the required system items.
> 3. Click <i class="fa fa-check fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> to save the changes.

## Reset Custom Translations to the Default Ones

To remove one or more custom translations and roll back to the default translation downloaded from the Crowdin service, click <i class="fa fa-caret-down fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> in the left corner of the list header. Confirm the removal by clicking the **Reset** button.

* The **All** option enables to select all the translations available under this section.
* The **All visible** option enables to select only the translations visible on the page you are currently viewing.
* The **None** option enables to deselect all the translations which were selected previously.

Hover over the <i class="fa fa-ellipsis-h fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> **More Options** menu at the end of the list header and click <i class="fas fa-sync-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Reset** to delete multiple custom translations at a time.
