# Manage Localizations, Languages, and Translations in the Back-Office

#### HINT
This section is part of the [Localization and Translation](../../../concept-guides/administration/localization/index.md#concept-guide-localization-translation) concept guide that provides a general understanding of the localization and translation processes in OroCommerce.

#### NOTE
The Localization configuration is accessible from the Global organization only. Find more on working with organizations in the [Company Structure and Organization Selector](../../getting-started/navigation/org-selector.md#user-guide-getting-started-company-structure).

[Localization](../../../glossary.md#term-Localization) is the process of translating and adapting a product for a specific country or region. Oro application allows a user to customize the format of date and time, numeric, percent, and monetary values as well as the format of names and addresses.

Oro application supports localization and provides decent out-of-the-box translation coverage for the most used languages. With out-of-the-box integration to CrowdIn service, Oro applications have live access to the most recent updates from the Oro team and community.

See [How to Contribute to Translations](../../../../community/contribute/code-ui-translations.md#doc-community-ui-translations) for more information about the translation process.
