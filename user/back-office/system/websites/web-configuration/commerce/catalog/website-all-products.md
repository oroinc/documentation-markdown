# Configure All Products Page per Website

#### HINT
This section is part of the [Product Management](../../../../../../concept-guides/product-management/index.md#concept-guides-product-management) topic that provides a general understanding of the product concept in OroCommerce.

In your Oro back-office, you can enable and configure the All Products page for the OroCommerce storefront. When configured, such page should display all available products from the master catalog grouped by categories.

## Flow

To configure the All Products page:

1. Enable **All Products Page** in system configuration on the required level â€” [globally](../../../../configuration/commerce/catalog/global-all-products.md#sys-conf-commerce-catalog-special-pages-global) or per website (see below).
2. Add it to the storefront as part of either your [web catalog](../../../../../marketing/web-catalogs/edit-content-tree/content-variants.md#user-guide-marketing-web-catalog) (**Marketing > Web Catalog**) or frontend menu (**System > Frontend Menus**) on the required level:
   * [Globally](../../../../frontend-menus/global-all-products-menus.md#sys-conf-frontend-menus-all-products-global) (**System > Frontend Menus**)
   * [Per organization](../../../../user-management/organizations/organization-all-products-menus.md#sys-users-organization-menus-all-products-organization) (**System > User Management > Organizations**)
   * [Per website](../../../website-all-products-menu.md#sys-users-organization-menus-all-products-website) (**System > Websites**)
   * [Per customer group](../../../../../customers/customer-groups/customer-group-all-products-menus.md#user-guide-customers-customer-groups-all-products) (**Customers > Customer Group**)
   * [Per customer](../../../../../customers/customers/customer-all-products-menus.md#user-guide-customers-customers-all-products) (**Customers > Customers**)
3. Check the [example of adding the All Products page](#user-guide-all-products-sample) for your reference.

#### NOTE
Please note that it is recommended to enable the All Products page exclusively for *small catalogs* with no more than a few hundred products, otherwise browser performance might be affected.

## An Example of Adding All Products Page
