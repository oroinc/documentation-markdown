# Configure Guest Website Access Settings per Website

#### HINT
This section is part of the [Guest Functions](../../../../../../concept-guides/administration/guests/index.md#sys-conf-commerce-guest) topic that provides a general understanding of the guest access concept in OroCommerce.

To manage guest access per website:

1. Navigate to **System > Websites**.
2. For the necessary website, hover over the <i class="fa fa-ellipsis-h fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> **More Options** menu to the right of the necessary website, and click <i class="fas fa-cog" aria-hidden="true"></i> to start editing the configuration.
3. Select **Commerce > Guests > Website Access** in the menu on the left.

#### NOTE
For faster navigation between the configuration menu sections, use [Quick Search](../../../../configuration/quick-search.md#user-guide-system-configuration-quick-search).

1. Clear the **Use Organization** checkbox to change the organization-wide setting.
2. In the Website Access section, toggle the **Enable Guest Access** checkbox to enable or disable guest users from browsing the website.

   When **Enable Guest Access** is disabled, the storefront becomes inaccessible to guest users except for the login/forgot/reset password page and any system or landing pages explicitly allowed by the administrator.

   In this case, the following additional options become available (available starting from OroCommerce version 6.1.7):
   * **Allow Guest Access to System Pages** — Select the system pages that should remain available to guest users.
   * **Allow Guest Access to Landing Pages** — Select the landing (CMS) pages that should remain available to guest users.
3. Click **Save Settings**.
