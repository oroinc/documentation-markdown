# Configure Product Search Settings per Website

To configure the product search settings per website:

1. Navigate to  **System > Websites** in the main menu.
2. For the necessary website, hover over the <i class="fa fa-ellipsis-h fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> more actions menu to the right of the necessary website and click <i class="fas fa-cog" aria-hidden="true"></i> to start editing the configuration.
3. Select **Commerce > Product > Product Search** in the menu to the left.

   #### NOTE
   For faster navigation between the configuration menu sections, use [Quick Search](../../../../configuration/quick-search.md#user-guide-system-configuration-quick-search).

4. Customize any of the options by proceeding through the following steps:
   1. Clear the **Use Organization** checkbox next to the option.
   2. Enable the required checkbox or enter the necessary file size and type information.
5. In the **Product Fulltext Search** section, configure the following options:
   * **Number of Products in Search Autocomplete** — Maximum number of products shown in the storefront autocomplete dropdown.
   * **Allow Partial Product Search** — When enabled, the customer can find a product in the global search and on quick order form using a substring inside a word. Enabling this option may have a performance impact on search behaviour.
