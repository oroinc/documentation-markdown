# Configure Settings for Featured Products per Website

You can control which segment is used to store featured products [globally](../../../../configuration/commerce/product/global-featured-products.md#products-featured-products), [per organization](../../../../user-management/organizations/org-configuration/commerce/product/organization-featured-products.md#sys-users-organization-commerce-products-featured-products), and per website.

Before enabling the featured products segment for a particular website, make sure you have performed the following actions:

1. Mark the selected products as featured in the **General** section of the **Products > Products** main menu by setting **Is Featured** to *Yes*.
2. Create a featured product segment under **Reports & Segments > Manage Segments** as described in the [Create Segment](../../../../../reports-segments/segments.md#user-guide-business-intelligence-create-segments) topic.

Now, update the featured products segment for a website:

1. Navigate to **System > Website** in the main menu.
2. For the necessary website, hover over the <i class="fa fa-ellipsis-h fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> **More Options** menu to the right of the necessary website and click the <i class="fas fa-cog" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Configuration** icon to start editing the configuration.
3. Select **Commerce > Products > Featured Products** in the menu to the left.

#### NOTE
For faster navigation between the configuration menu sections, use [Quick Search](../../../../configuration/quick-search.md#user-guide-system-configuration-quick-search).

1. To customize the segment option:
   > 1. Clear the **Use Organization** checkbox next to the option.
   > 2. Select the new segment from the list.
2. Click **Save**.
