# Configure Settings for Product Images per Website

You can update the product watermark settings, enable image preview and configure whether to use popup or inline view for the image gallery per website:

1. Navigate to  **System > Websites** in the main menu.
2. For the necessary website, hover over the <i class="fa fa-ellipsis-h fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> more actions menu to the right of the necessary website and click <i class="fas fa-cog" aria-hidden="true"></i> to start editing the configuration.
3. Select **Commerce > Product > Product Images** in the menu to the left.

   #### NOTE
   For faster navigation between the configuration menu sections, use [Quick Search](../../../../configuration/quick-search.md#user-guide-system-configuration-quick-search).

#### NOTE
As of application version 5.0.2, the **Enable Original File Names** option is hidden. To configure the original image file names, navigate to [General Setup > Upload Settings](../../general-sys-config/general/website-upload-settings.md#upload-settings-website) in the system configuration.

1. Clear the **Use Organization** checkbox to change the organization-wide setting.
2. In the **Product Image Watermark** section, the following options are available:
   * **File** – The image file with the watermark on a transparent background.
   * **Size** – The size of the watermark in percentage compared to the whole image.
   * **Position** – The watermark position on the image (e.g, top left, top, top right, left, right, center, bottom left, bottom, and bottom right).
3. In the **Image Gallery Options** section, the following options are available:
   * **Enable Image Preview on Product Listing** — When this option is enabled, clicking on the product image on the product listing page in the storefront will open a pop up image gallery, rather than the product page.

     When the option is disabled, clicking on the product image on the product listing page in the storefront will open the product page.

4. When **Popup Gallery on Product View** is enabled, image gallery in the storefront takes the following form:
   ![image](user/img/system/websites/web_configuration/ImageGalleryWebsiteEnabled1.png)

   By clicking on the image, the pop up gallery is displayed in the middle of the screen:
   ![image](user/img/system/websites/web_configuration/ImageGalleryWebsiteEnabled2.png)
5. When **Popup Gallery on Product View** is disabled, the image gallery takes the form of an inline view:
   <!-- image::/img/system/websites/web_configuration/ImageGalleryWebsiteDisabled.png
   :class: with-border -->

   Flick through the pictures in the gallery by pressing < or > arrows without leaving the product page.
