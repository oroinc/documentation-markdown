3. Click **System Configuration > Integrations > Google Settings** in the menu to the left.

   > * For the **Google Tag Manager** Integration filed, select the [GTM integration](../../../../integrations/gtm-ga4/index.md#gtm-ga-4-integration) you have configured for the application. Click **Save** to display an additional option.
   > * For **Data Collection For**, select the Google Analytics type (Universal, GA4, or both) that connects to your GTM account to enable data mapping.
