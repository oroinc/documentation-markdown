# Configure Contact Groups in the Back-Office

A **contact group** is a system entity that represents a group of [contacts](../../../glossary.md#term-Contact). By default, contact groups are used in [filters and segments](../../reports-segments/filters.md#user-guide-filters-management).

## Create a Contact Group

To create a contact group:

1. Navigate to **System > Contact Groups** in the main menu.
2. Click **Create Contact Group**.
3. Define the general details and the list of contacts for the group:
   * **Owner** — Limits the list of users who can manage the contact group to the users whose [roles](../user-management/roles/index.md#user-guide-user-management-permissions) allow managing contact groups of the owner (e.g., the owner, members of the same business unit, system administrator, etc.).
   * **Label** — The name used to refer to the contact group on the interface.
4. Select/clear the **HAS GROUP**  checkbox, to assign/unassign a contact to the contact group.

#### NOTE
The **HAS GROUP** checkbox defines if the contact is assigned a specific contact group that you are creating/editing.

1. Click **Save and Close**.

Now, you can <i class="fa fa-edit fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> edit or <i class="fas fa-trash-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i> delete a contact group from the system by clicking the corresponding icon next to the required row in the grid.
