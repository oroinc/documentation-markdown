# Manage Segments in the Back-Office

Segments are dynamically filtered subsets of the data (e.g., product collection, marketing list). To use a set of records in reports, filters, web catalog nodes, or marketing lists, you can create a segment and reuse it instead of copying the same query as a condition.

Segment combines a set of records filtered using the query that may use the following information as the foundation:

* Activity
* Data audit
* Field Condition
* Segment
* Condition Group

Dynamic segments refresh automatically. Segments of manual type require explicit refresh by clicking **Refresh** <i class="fas fa-sync-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i>.

   1. Fill in the segment name.
   2. *Optionally*, add a **Description** to help you and other users understand the segmentâ€™s purpose or peculiarities in the future.
   3. Select the primary entity that segment should look up.
   4. Select the segment type from the list. **Dynamic** segments are updated as soon as any changes have occurred in the system. **Manual** segments are updated only following the manual refresh action when viewing the segment details.
   5. Optionally, specify the records limit. The segment shows the first X results in case the limit is provided.
   6. Select the segment owner - a business unit, members of which can manage the segment, subject to the roles defined in the system.
4. In the *Designer > Columns* section, define the set of the fields of the entity records to be shown in the segment.

   To add a column to the grid:
   > 1. Choose a field from the drop-down in the **Column** section.
   > 2. Type in a label to refer to the field in the segment report on the interface. The field label is used by default. Customize it if necessary.
   > 3. Define the sorting order for at least one column in the segment to sort the resulting data set by the field value.
   > 4. Click **Add** button.
   > 5. Reorder the columns by clicking on the line and dragging it to the necessary location.

   > - Change the column position, dragging the column by the <i class="fas fa-arrows-alt-v" aria-hidden="true"></i> icon.
