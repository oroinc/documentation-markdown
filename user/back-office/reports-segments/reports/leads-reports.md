# Leads Reports

Oro applications provide ready-to-use **Leads by Date** and **Leads by Geography** reports.

**Leads by Date** report shows how many leads were created on a specific date for all channels.

To see the report, navigate to **Reports and Segments > Reports > Leads > Leads By Date.**

Leads by Date report shows:

- The date leads were created on
- The number of the leads created on a specific date
- Total amount of the leads created

In the [global organization](../../system/user-management/organizations/index.md#user-ee-multi-org), lead details are displayed per organization. Organizations without global access can view lead details specific to their organization only.

To see the report, navigate to **Reports and Segments > Leads > Leads By Geography**. You can edit and delete the report from the report’s grid page.
