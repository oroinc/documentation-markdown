# Manage System and Custom Reports in the Back-Office

In Oro applications, you can create reports based on the details of any entity available in the system.

You can get easy-to-understand adjustable reports on the budgets and activity of different
customers, on statuses of carts and the current state of actual and potential sales, on the performance of your
[marketing effort](../../marketing/index.md#user-guide-marketing), specifics of recent [activities](../../activities/index.md#user-guide-activities), etc.

There are several out-of-the-box reports, such as [Leads by Date](leads-reports.md#doc-leads-reports) and
[Opportunities by Status](opportunities-reports.md#user-guide-opportunities-reports-opportunities-by-status), but you can also create your custom reports.

System reports are read-only. You can view the report output and filter the resulting data.
