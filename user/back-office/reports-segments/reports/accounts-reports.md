Oro applications come with two ready-to-use reports on accounts, Accounts Life Time Value and Accounts by Opportunities.

The **Accounts Life Time Value** report is located under **Reports and Segments > Reports > Accounts > Life Time**. It enables you to see the total amount of money received from all the customers assigned to the account. It displayed the account name, the total [Lifetime Sales Value](../../../glossary.md#term-Lifetime-Sales-Value) registered in your Oro application.
