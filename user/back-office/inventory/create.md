# Manage Warehouses in the Back-Office

#### HINT
This section is part of the [Inventory and Warehouse Management](../../concept-guides/catalog-promotions/inventory/index.md#concept-guide-inventory) topic that provides a general understanding of the inventory and warehouse concepts.

## Create a Warehouse

#### NOTE
Creating multiple warehouses is an Enterprise edition feature. When adding a new organization, remember to update the [organizationâ€™s configuration settings](../system/user-management/organizations/index.md#user-management-organizations) (including its owner and a [warehouse](../system/user-management/organizations/org-configuration/commerce/inventory/organization-warehouses.md#warehouses-organization)).

To create a new warehouse:

1. Navigate to **Inventory > Warehouses** using the main menu.
   ![The list of all warehouses available in the system](user/img/inventory/Warehouses.png)
2. Click **Create Warehouses**. The following page opens:
   ![The create warehouse page](user/img/inventory/WarehousesCreate.png)
3. Enter the warehouse name.
4. Fill in the address:
   * To use the default warehouse address from the shipping system configuration, set the **Use Shipping Origin** box.
   * To use a custom warehouse address, enter the Country, Region/State, Zip/Postal code, City, and street address.
5. Click **Save**.

You can perform the following actions here:

* Create a warehouse: Click the button on the top right.
* **View Warehouse details**: Click on the warehouse to open its details page.
* **Edit Warehouse details**: Click <i class="fa fa-edit fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> at the end of the row to start editing the selected warehouse details. You might need to click the <i class="fa fa-ellipsis-h fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> **More Options** menu at the end of the row to reach the <i class="fa fa-edit fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> icon.
* **Delete a Warehouse**: Click the <i class="fa fa-ellipsis-h fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> **More Options** menu at the end of the row, and then click the ![Trash-SVG](_themes/sphinx_rtd_theme/static/svg-icons/trash.svg) **Delete** icon.

#### NOTE
If the warehouse has been enabled in the [global system configuration](../system/configuration/commerce/inventory/product-options.md#sys-conf-commerce-inventory-product-options-global) with no other warehouses enabled, you cannot delete it.
