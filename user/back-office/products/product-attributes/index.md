# Manage Product Attributes in the Back-Office

## Overview

#### HINT
This section is part of the [Product Management](../../../concept-guides/catalog-promotions/product-management/index.md#concept-guides-product-management) topic that provides a general understanding of the product concept in OroCommerce.

A [Product Attribute](../../../glossary.md#term-Product-Attribute) is a type of a custom field in the product details. For product attributes, OroCommerce enables you to manage and group attributes that are unique to a particular product family. By adding the product attributes only to the product families they fit, you can limit the product data to the necessary characteristics.

For example, when your OroCommerce store sells TVs and T-shirts, these items share some generic attributes (e.g., name, vendor), and differ in the remaining attributes set. For example, there might be a *Screen properties* group containing *resolution*, *diagonal*, and *matrix* that should be linked to the products in the TV product family. For the T-shirts family, the linked attribute group may have color, size, material, fit, and care guidance (washing, ironing, dry cleaning, etc.).

#### NOTE
You can manage product attributes per organization. Any changes made to product attributes within one organization do not affect the attributes of others. You can use the attributes created in the global organization in other organizations, but only a system administrator of the global organization can edit them.

By default, OroCommerce comes with the following system product attributes:

![The list of the default system product attributes](user/img/products/product_attributes/ProductAttributes_oob.png)

Add new product attributes to introduce new custom parameters in your product details. Include product attributes in one or multiple product families into the new or existing attribute group.

#### NOTE
System attributes are shared among all product families. You can reorganize the way system attributes are grouped, but you cannot remove a product attribute from the product family.

#### HINT
Instead of using one general-purpose attribute (e.g., color), create multiple specific attributes (e.g., car_color, laptop_color, table_color). This prevents loading all attributes as filters on all product pages and as a result, reduces the load on the database and improves the overall application performance.

## Create a Product Attribute

See a short demo on <a href="https://academy.oroinc.com/media-library/create-product-attributes-families" target="_blank">how to create product attributes</a>, or keep reading the step-by-step guidance below.

The creation of an attribute happens in two steps:

* In step 1, specify basic properties, such as the attribute name and type.
* In step 2, you specify more advanced properties, some of which may depend on the selected attribute type.

### Step 1: Select Attribute Type

To create an attribute:

1. Navigate to **Products > Product Attributes** using the main menu.
2. Click **Create Attribute**.

#### HINT
You may receive the following warning message, which notifies you about the limits for the number of attributes that can be created, which can affect the future export of entities.

| The number of attributes stored as columns in the X table (the attributes that are relations or that have ever been marked<br/>as “A”, “B”, “C”) is approaching the limit after which it will no longer be possible to export Y with the standard X export.<br/>Remaining number of attributes - approximately Z.   |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Once 90% of the limit is reached, you will receive a flash message with the related warning.

Reaching 100% of the limit triggers a warning message on a potential inactive export when clicking the Export button.

1. Complete the following fields:

| **Field Name**   | Fill in the field name that should be used to store the values of the product attribute. It should be between 2 and 22 characters long. Use only alphabetic symbols, underscore, and numbers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| **Type**         | Select an attribute type to store the value of the specific data type. For the list of available field types and their purposes, refer to the [relevant section](../../system/entities/entity-fields/entity-fields-basic-properties.md#field-file-types) of the Entity Field Properties topic or see descriptions in Step 2 below.<br/><br/>Select one of the **Relations** for the attribute to connect your custom entities as product information (these can be used for business intelligence and segments):<br/><br/>- **Many to many** — No limit on how many entity records of the selected type can be connected to the attribute, e.g., many custom entity records can be related to many products.<br/>- **Many to one** — Attributes cannot have more than one entity record related to them, e.g., Products A-Z can relate to Promotion A. Product A cannot relate to multiple promotions. You can reuse the same promotion in multiple product details.<br/>- **One to many** — One attribute can relate to many entity records, but every related entity record can be connected only once. For example, product A can be related to many promotions, but Promotion A cannot be related to multiple products. |

### Step 2: Provide Type-Based Details

Proceed to create the attribute as described below.

1. Fill in remaining general information:
   * **Label** — Enter the attribute label. It will be displayed both in the back-office and in the storefront.
   * **Description** — When filled in, the description will be used as a field tooltip when the attribute appears on the forms.

The product attributes with a smaller value of the grid order number will be displayed before the attributes with a bigger value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Show On View**                 | Select *Yes* if you wish to have this product attribute displayed on the product view page.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Priority**                     | Priority defines the order of the product attributes on the view, edit, create pages. Custom product attributes are always displayed one by one, usually below the system fields. If no priority is defined or the defined priority is 0, the product attributes will be displayed in the order in which they have been added to the system. The product attributes with a higher priority (a smaller value) will be displayed before the attributes with a lower priority.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Searchable**                   | When set to *Yes*, the attribute is included in the search options in the back-office.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Auditable**                    | When set to *Yes*, the system will log changes made to this product attribute value when a user edits the product details.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

1. Once all options are configured, and the necessary information is provided, click **Save**.
2. If the created attribute is of a *table column* [storage type](../../system/entities/entity-fields/entity-fields-basic-properties.md#admin-guide-create-entity-fields-basic), click **Update Schema** to reindex the data for search and filter.

#### NOTE
The product attribute [storage type](../../system/entities/entity-fields/entity-fields-basic-properties.md#admin-guide-create-entity-fields-basic) is set to *table column* for the attribute with Select of Multi-Select data type, and also for the attribute of any type with *Filterable* or *Sortable* option enabled. If this step is omitted, the newly created attribute will not appear in the select attribute options in other areas of OroCommerce (e.g., product families configuration).

> You can check an attribute’s storage type on the page with the attributes list:

#### WARNING
Schema changes are permanent and cannot be easily rolled back. We recommend that developers back up data before any database schema change if changes have to be rolled back.

## Import Product Attributes

**Import File** option helps import a large bulk of product attributes information into the product attributes list using the .csv file.

**Example of product attributes bulk import template**

| fieldName   | type   | entity.label   | entity.description   | entity.contact_information   | form.is_enabled   | importexport.header   |   importexport.order | importexport.identity   | attachment.mimetypes   |
|-------------|--------|----------------|----------------------|------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| field_money | money  | label_value    | description_value    | marketinglist.entity_config. | yes               | header_value          |                   12 | no                      | mimetypes_value        |

#### NOTE
Keep in mind that multi-select attribute type doesn’t support the sorting option, so make sure to set this option to “0” or “No” when preparing the corresponding file for importing.

To import a bulk of product attributes:

1. In the main menu, navigate to **Products > Product Attributes**.
2. Click **Import File** on the top right.

#### HINT
You may receive the following warning message which notifies you about the limits for the number of attributes that can be imported, which can effect the future export of entities.

| The number of attributes stored as columns in the X table (the attributes that are relations or that have ever been marked<br/>as “A”, “B”, “C”) is approaching the limit after which it will no longer be possible to export Y with the standard X export.<br/>Remaining number of attributes - approximately Z.   |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Pay attention that the maximum number of columns in the row must fit in a single 8192-byte heap page. For example, if all the columns are simple fields, such as integer values, then the quantity of columns can reach 1,600. The number of fields or attributes in the exporting entity must be within the bespoke limit; otherwise, this may impose a restriction on export functionality.

Once 90% of the limit is reached, you will receive a flash message with the related warning.

Reaching 100% of the limit triggers a warning message on a potential inactive export when clicking the Export button.

1. **Prepare data for import**: Create your bulk information in the .csv format. Once your file is ready, click **Choose File**, select the prepared comma-separated values (.csv) file, and click **Import File**.

#### NOTE
Ensure that your .csv file is saved in the Unicode (UTF-8) encoding. Otherwise, the content of the file can be rendered improperly.

![The steps that are necessary to perform to import the product attributes successfully](user/img/products/product_attributes/import_product_attributes.png)
1. **Validate import results**: Click **Validate** to check your import results. If there are any *Records with errors*, fix them in the .csv file before starting the import.
2. **Launch import:** After successful validation, click **Import File**.
3. Click **Cancel** to decline the import.

#### IMPORTANT
Interactive status messages inform about the import progress, and once the import is complete, the changes are reflected in the list upon refresh. Additionally, an email message with the import status is delivered to your mailbox.

Follow the on-screen guidance for any additional actions. For example, for the inventory template, select one of the options: a) inventory statuses only or b) detailed inventory levels.
