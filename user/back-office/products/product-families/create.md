2. Click **Create Product Family**.

3. Provide the product family details:
   - **Code** – Enter the code that would be assigned to the product family you are creating.
   - **Label** – Enter the label that would be assigned to the product family.
   - **Enabled** – Select this checkbox to be able to bind a product to the product family.
   - **Image** – Add an image to the product family, if necessary.
4. In the **Attributes** section, link the attributes to the product family and organize them into groups as described in the sections below.

   #### IMPORTANT
   Ensure that every system attribute is linked to the proper attribute group in the product family. By default, they are linked to the default_group, but you may modify the link as necessary.

1. Once you are happy with the product attribute organization, click **Save**.
