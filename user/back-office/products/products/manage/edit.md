## From the Product List

1. In the main menu, navigate to **Products > Products**. The product list opens.
2. Choose the product you want to modify, click the <i class="fa fa-ellipsis-h fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> **More Options** menu at the end of the row, and then click the <i class="fa fa-edit fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Edit** icon.
3. Change the product settings as required. For the description of the fields, see [Create a Product](../index.md#doc-products-actions-create) action description.
4. Click **Save and Close** on the top right of the page.

## Inline Editing

You can also perform inline editing to amend product details directly from the list.

#### NOTE
Inline editing is available for a limited number of fields.

Point to the field that you want to edit, and if the <i class="fas fa-pencil-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Edit Inline** icon appears next to a value, it means that inline editing is available for it.

To edit a product inline, double-click the field or the <i class="fas fa-pencil-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Edit Inline** icon in the field you need to edit and modify the value as required.
