# Manage Product Pricing

You can add a product price when editing a single product in the Product Prices section of the product details page, as well as centrally manage prices for all products using [price lists](../../../../concept-guides/catalog-promotions/pricing/index.md#user-guide-pricing).

For more information on pricing, checkout the following topics:

* [Pricing in OroCommerce](../../../../concept-guides/catalog-promotions/pricing/index.md#user-guide-pricing)
* [Adding Pricing to Individual Products](../../../sales/price-lists/manual.md#user-guide-pricing-price-list-manual-product-details)

When viewing details of a product, you can preview the prices that were assigned to this product manually and using the rule-based price lists.

In the **Product Prices** section, you can filter the prices by price list, quantity (a tier), unit, currency, and the monetary amount.

![Filter by a price list, quantity, units, value, and currency is available in the Product Prices section](user/img/products/products/ProductPriceFilter.png)

You can get to the price list that stores the particular price by clicking <i class="fa fa-eye fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> at the end of the row with the price information.
