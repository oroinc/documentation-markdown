## Checklist

Prior to creating a [configurable product](../../../glossary.md#term-Configurable-Product), ensure that you have performed the following steps:

1. Created [attributes](../product-attributes/index.md#products-product-attributes-create).

   A configurable attribute is one of the product attributes that are used to distinguish [product variants](index.md#doc-products-actions-create) of the same configurable product. There should be at least one configurable attribute specified for the configurable product in order to enable a customer to select product variants.
2. Created a [product family](../product-families/create.md#product-product-families-create).

   As a configurable product and all of its variants share the same set of attributes, they should share the product family as well.
3. Created [product variants (simple products)](create-simple.md#products-products-create-simple-product).

   A configurable product may group several simple products or configurable product variants whose information mostly overlaps except for several product attributes. It means that you have to create a simple product for each variant that you need to add to the configurable product.

   #### NOTE
   Make sure the configurable product you are creating has the same product unit as its product variants.

   #### NOTE
   Product variants for configurable products in the storefront are displayed only when either customer users are logged in or [guest shopping lists](../../../concept-guides/guests/index.md#sys-conf-commerce-guest) are enabled in the system configuration.

## Flow

To add a new configurable product and make it available in the master catalog (for internal product management) and for purchase in the storefront:

1. Navigate to **Products > Products** using the main menu.
2. Click **Create Product**.
3. From the **Type** list, select *Configurable* to enable product variants.
4. Select the [product family](../product-families/index.md#products-product-families) to define the product options and details that will be filled in the following steps.

   #### NOTE
   Ensure that the product attributes that store product variant options are created and included in the productâ€™s product family.
5. Place the product under the necessary category in the master catalog by clicking on the category. Use the search to filter the list of categories.
6. Click **Continue**. The product details page appears.
7. In the **General** section, provide the following information:

   | Field                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

1. Click **Save** to save your configurable product.

Once the core product information is saved, you may add related products and up-sell products to display them in the **Related Items** section in the product details in the back-office, and in the **Related Products** and **Up-sell Products** blocks next to the product details in the storefront. See the [Add Related Items](create-simple.md#products-related-items) for more details.

## Create a Sample Configurable Product

The sample flow below shows all the steps required for the creation of a configurable product.

*Product: Red and green hats, sizes S and M.*

**Step 1. Create Attributes.**

1. Navigate to **Products > Product Attributes** in the main menu.
2. Click **Create Attribute** on the top right.

   We will create two attributes, one after another: â€˜hatcolorâ€™ and â€˜hatsizeâ€™.
3. Select the type of an attribute.

   Currently, *Select* and *Boolean* types are available for configurable attributes. We will use *Select* for both attributes.
4. Fill in the required information and add the necessary options for the attributes by clicking **+Add**.

   For â€˜hatcolorâ€™, attribute options will be â€˜Redâ€™ and â€˜Greenâ€™.
   ![Create the HatColor product attribute with the red and green options](user/img/products/products/SampleHatColor.png)

   For â€˜hatsizeâ€™, attribute options will be â€˜Sâ€™ and â€˜Mâ€™.
   ![Create the HatSize product attribute with the s and m options](user/img/products/products/SampleHatSize.png)
5. Click **Save** to save the attributes.

![Newly created attributes are displayed in the list of all product attributes](user/img/products/products/SampleHatColorSizeGrid.png)

**Step 2. Create a Product Family.**

1. Navigate to **Products > Product Families** in the main menu.
2. Click **Create Product Family** in the top right corner.
3. Fill in the required information and add attributes â€˜HatColorâ€™ and â€˜HatSizeâ€™ to the attribute group by clicking **+Add**.

   Each attribute must have a separate group in our case.
   ![Add new product attributes to separate groups when creating a product family](user/img/products/products/SampleProductFamily.png)
4. Click **Save** to save the product family.

**Step 3. Create Configurable Product Variants.**

We now need to create one configurable product variant (simple product) per each variant that we would like to have available in the configurable product. Since we have two attributes, â€˜HatSizeâ€™ and â€˜HatColorâ€™, and each attribute has two options (â€˜Sâ€™/â€™Mâ€™ for the first and â€˜Redâ€™/â€™Greenâ€™ for the second), we need to create four simple products.

1. Navigate to **Products > Products** in the main menu.
2. Click **Create Product** in the top right corner.
3. Set the product type to *Simple*, select the â€˜HATSâ€™ product family.
4. Fill in the required information and add the attributes required for this particular product.
   ![Illustrate a simple product creation based on the provided parameters](user/img/products/products/SampleSimpleProduct1.png)
5. Click **Save**.

Perform step 3 for all four simple products.

#### NOTE
Make sure that all your simple products are *enabled*.

![Display all created simple products in the products' grid](user/img/products/products/SampleSimpleProductsGrid.png)

**Step 4. Create a Configurable Product.**

1. Navigate to **Products > Products** in the main menu.
2. Click **Create Product**.
3. Set the product type to *Configurable*.
4. Select the category.

   #### NOTE
   Choosing category is mandatory at this stage, as it determines whether the product is available on the website.
5. Choose the â€˜Hatsâ€™ product family.
   ![Illustrate a configurable product creation based on the provided parameters](user/img/products/products/SampleCreateConfigProduct.png)
6. Add â€˜HatSizeâ€™ and â€˜HatColorâ€™ attributes to the product.
7. Fill in the required information and add the created product variants for this configurable product.

   #### NOTE
   You might want to save the product at this point to make sure that product variants are available in the **Product Variants** section of the product you are creating.

   ![Display the product variants available for the configurable product in the Product Variants section](user/img/products/products/SampleProductVariantsForConfigProduct.png)
8. Click **Save**.
   ![Display all created simple and configurable products in the products' grid](user/img/products/products/SampleConfigSimpleGrid1.png)

The product should now be available on the website in the category we have previously assigned it to.
