# Get Started with Products in the Back-Office

#### HINT
This section is part of the [Product Management](../../concept-guides/product-management/index.md#concept-guides-product-management) topic that provides a general understanding of the product concept in OroCommerce.

OroCommerce enables you to create and manage products in a way that precisely fits your business strategies and requirements.

You can start with the [Products](products/index.md#doc-products-before-you-begin) section to familiarize yourself with the product cycle in OroCommerce, find out how to create different types of products (simple and configurable), and how to set up a matrix form to display multiple variations of one configurable product in the storefront.

Refer to the [Products Grid](products/manage/index.md#doc-products-characteristics) section to learn about the actions available for products from the grid, such as duplicating, importing, or inline editing, as well as how to manage product quantities in multiple warehouses on the product page. Remember that the multi-warehouse feature is only available in the Enterprise edition.

To learn more about how to control the visibility of the products you created for specific customers, customer groups, or websites, navigate to the [Manage Product Visibility](products/managing-product-visibility.md#products-product-visibility) section. Here, you will learn how to set up specific visibility settings and configure visibility priorities.

Organize all existing products in your store under corresponding categories with the [Master Catalog](master-catalog/index.md#user-guide-master-catalog) and personalize it the way you need.

To learn how to associate your products with specific brands and create them in the back-office, head for the [Use Product Brands](product-brands/index.md#user-guide-product-brands) section.

To check what flows in terms of product creation and management best suit your business, check out the [Blueprints]() section below.
