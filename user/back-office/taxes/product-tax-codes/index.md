# Manage Product Tax Codes in the Back-Office

<!-- begin -->

#### HINT
This section is part of the [Tax Management](../../../concept-guides/administration/taxes/index.md#concept-guide-taxes) concept guide that provides a general understanding of the tax configuration and management in OroCommerce.

[Product Tax Code](../../../glossary.md#term-Product-Tax-Code) is a label that is assigned to a product or product group and indicates the tax obligations and exemptions customers have when they purchase this product. These tax obligations are taken into account when a customer (user) submits an order.

The sections below provide guidance on managing product tax codes, using them to label products and bind products to dedicated tax rules.

## Create a Product Tax Code

To create a new product tax code:

1. Navigate to **Taxes > Product Tax Codes** in the main menu.
2. Click **Create Product Tax Codes**.
3. Fill in **Code** and **Description** with information about the product tax code you are creating.
4. Click **Save and Close**.

## Manage Product Tax Codes

To manage product tax codes, navigate to **Taxes > Product Tax Codes** in the main menu.

#### NOTE
To handle a big volume of data, use the page switcher, increase *View Per Page* or use filters to narrow down the list to just the codes you need.

In the product tax codes list, you will find the information about the code (unique identifier), detailed description, and the dates when the product tax code was created and updated.

Hover over the <i class="fa fa-ellipsis-h fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> **More Options** menu to the right of the item and click <i class="fa fa-eye fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> to open its details page, <i class="fa fa-edit fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> to edit, or ![Trash-SVG](_themes/sphinx_rtd_theme/static/svg-icons/trash.svg) to remove the product tax code.
