# Create a Product Tax Code

<!-- begin -->

To create a new product tax code:

1. Navigate to **Taxes > Product Tax Codes** in the main menu.
2. Click **Create Product Tax Codes**.
3. Fill in **Code** and **Description** with information about the product tax code you are creating.
4. Click **Save and Close**.

<!-- stop -->

#### HINT
Now that the product tax code is created, link it to [a product](link-a-tax-code-to-a-product.md#user-guide-taxes-link-a-tax-code-to-a-product) and [create a tax rule](../tax-rules/create.md#tax-rules-create) that associates the product tax code with the tax rate or tax exemption (zero rate).
