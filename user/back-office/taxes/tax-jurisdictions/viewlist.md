# View and Filter Tax Jurisdictions

<!-- begin -->

To view all tax jurisdictions, navigate to **Taxes > Tax Jurisdictions** in the main menu.

![The page of all tax available tax jurisdictions](user/img/taxes/tax_jurisdiction_all.png)

#### NOTE
To handle a big volume of data, use the page switcher, increase *View Per Page* or use filters to narrow down the list to just the codes you need.

In the tax jurisdictions list, you will find the information about the code (unique identifier), detailed description, and the dates when the tax jurisdiction was created and updated.

Hover over the <i class="fa fa-ellipsis-h fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> **More Options** menu to the right of the item and click <i class="fa fa-eye fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> to open its details page, <i class="fa fa-edit fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> to edit, or  <i class="fas fa-trash-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i> to remove the tax jurisdiction.
