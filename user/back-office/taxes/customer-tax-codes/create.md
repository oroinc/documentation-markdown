# Create a Customer Tax Code

<!-- begin -->

A customer tax code is a label for a group of customers that indicates the tax obligations and exemptions that a customer has. These tax obligations are considered when a customer submits an order.

To create a new customer tax code:

1. Navigate to **Taxes > Customer Tax Codes** in the main menu.
2. Click **Create Customer Tax Codes**.
3. Fill in **Owner**, **Code**, and **Description** with information about the customer tax code you are creating.
4. Click **Save and Close**.

<!-- stop -->

#### HINT
Now that the customer tax code is created, link it to [a customer](link-a-tax-code-to-a-customer.md#user-guide-taxes-link-a-tax-code-to-a-customer) and [create a tax rule](../tax-rules/create.md#tax-rules-create) that associates the customer tax code with the tax rate or tax exemption (zero rate).
