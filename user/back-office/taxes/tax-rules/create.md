To create tax rules for a particular tax jurisdiction, you need to complete the configuration of the tax options described in the [Tax Rule Prerequisites](../index.md#tax-rule-prerequisites) section.

Once all the necessary actions are performed, you need to create a tax rule for every valid combination of the tax rates, product types, and customer types to ensure that they are properly taxed at every checkout.

1. Navigate to **Taxes > Tax Rules** and click **Create Tax Rule**.
