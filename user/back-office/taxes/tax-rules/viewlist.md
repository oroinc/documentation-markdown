# View and Filter Tax Rules

<!-- begin -->

To view all tax rules, navigate to **Taxes > Tax Rules** in the main menu.

![The list of all available tax rules](user/img/taxes/all_tax_rules.png)

#### NOTE
To handle a big volume of data, use the page switcher, increase *View Per Page* or use filters to narrow down the list to just the codes you need.

In the tax rules list, you will find the information about customer and product tax codes, tax jurisdiction, and tax rates that are linked to the tax rules, detailed description, and the dates when the tax rule was created and updated.

Hover over the <i class="fa fa-ellipsis-h fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> **More Options** menu to the right of the item and click <i class="fa fa-eye fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> to open its details page, <i class="fa fa-edit fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> to edit, or  <i class="fas fa-trash-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i> to remove the tax rule.
