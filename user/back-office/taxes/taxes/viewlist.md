# View and Filter Tax Rates

<!-- begin -->

To view all tax rates, navigate to **Taxes > Tax Rates** in the main menu.

![The page of all available tax rates](user/img/taxes/tax_rates_all.png)

#### NOTE
To handle big a volume of data, use the page switcher, increase *View Per Page* or use filters to narrow down the list to just the codes you need.

In the tax rate list, you will find the information about the tax ratesâ€™ codes (unique identifier), detailed description, and the dates when the tax rate was created and updated.

Hover over the <i class="fa fa-ellipsis-h fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> **More Options** menu to the right of the item and click <i class="fa fa-eye fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> to open its details page, <i class="fa fa-edit fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> to edit, or  ![Trash-SVG](_themes/sphinx_rtd_theme/static/svg-icons/trash.svg) to remove the tax rate.
