# Customer User Login Attempts

To simplify the investigation of any security-related incidents, the administrator can check the successful and unsuccessful
login attempts of customer users.

The login info data is stored in the database and the logs in the **security** log channel. The logs have the ID parameter used in the database to enable you to find a particular log item quickly.

The list of all customer user login attempts is available under **Customers > Customer User Login Attempts** in the main back-office menu.

The administrator can also open this list directly from the customer user view page by clicking on the link with the date of the  last login:

![Link to Customer User Login Attempts on View Page](user/img/customers/login_attempts/customer_user_view_page.png)

In this case, the data in the datagrid will be filtered by this customer user:
