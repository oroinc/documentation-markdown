# Add All Products Page to Frontend Menus per Customer

Once the All Products page has been enabled in the system configuration [globally](../../system/configuration/commerce/catalog/global-all-products.md#sys-conf-commerce-catalog-special-pages-global) or [per website](../../system/websites/web-configuration/commerce/catalog/website-all-products.md#sys-conf-commerce-catalog-special-pages-website), you can add it to a frontend menu of a particular customer:

1. Navigate to **Customers > Customers** in the main menu.

6. In the **Title** field, type in the label for the menu item.
7. In the **URI** field, specify  */catalog/allproducts*.
