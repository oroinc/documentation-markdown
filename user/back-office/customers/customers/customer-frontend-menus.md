# Customize Frontend Menus per Customer

#### HINT
This topic is part of [Frontend Menus](../../system/frontend-menus/index.md#backend-frontend-menus) where you can learn more about all available types of frontend menus, how to configure them on other levels, and edit their items.

To customize one of the storefront menus (e.g., commerce_main_menu) or customer/partner portal menus (e.g., customer_usermenu) for a particular customer:

1. Navigate to **Customers > Customers** in the main menu.
2. Click on the customer you would like to edit the menu for.
3. Click <i class="fas fa-cog" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Edit Frontend Menu**.
4. Update the menu contents following the guidelines provided in the [Edit a Frontend Menu](../../system/frontend-menus/edit-frontend-menu.md#user-guide-system-menu-menu-frontend) section.
   The changes apply automatically.
