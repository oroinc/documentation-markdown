# Manage dotmailer Data Fields and Mappings

## Data Fields

### Dotmailer Side

As well as utilizing the default contact data fields (FIRSTNAME, FULLNAME or LASTNAME) that are already in place in dotmailer address books, you can create new contact data fields to capture and/or contain additional information about your contacts. The more useful data you can collect on your contacts, the more you can proficiently segment, target and personalize your email campaigns, and in turn generate better response rates.

The default fields are listed on the **Default Data Fields** tab, while new customized fields are on **My Data Fields**. These are located in **Contacts > Contact Data fields**.

![Navigate to Contact Data fields under the Contacts main menu in the dotmailer side](user/img/marketing/marketing/dotmailer/dt_contacts_contact_data_fields.jpg)

Within **My Data Fields**, you can view, create or remove new data fields.

* **Name** — Enter a name for the data field. It should consist of alphnumeric characters only, with hyphens and underscores, if required.

* **Default Value** — When sending a campaign that uses template personalization, a default value ensures that a value is always displayed even if data field is blank. Default value depends on the data field type selected.

You can add a note for the data field you are creating in the **Additional** section in **Notes**.

Click **Save and Close** to save the new data field. Once saved, it will appear in the **Data Fields** grid.

From within the grid, you can also:

- Delete a field.

#### NOTE
System fields (e.g., FIRSTNAME, LASTNAME) cannot be deleted.

#### Sync Data Fields

By default, data fields are synchronized with dotmailer once a day. This interval can be changed in **System > Configuration > Integrations > dotmailer Settings > Synchronization Settings**. Synchronization can be also triggered manually by clicking the **Synchronize** button from data fields grid.

#### NOTE
Existing data fields cannot be updated.

## Data Field Mappings

**Data Field Mappings** is available under **Marketing** in the main menu.

![All data field mappings grid](user/img/marketing/marketing/dotmailer/data_field_mappings.jpg)

### Create a New Mapping

In order to export/import specific data fields from/to dotmailer, you can build the mapping between Oro entity fields and dotmailer data fields. When a new integration is created, default mappings for common data fields (FIRSTNAME, LASTNAME, and FULLNAME) are added automatically for Oro application entities (Contact, Lead, etc.). Existing mapping can be updated and new mappings can be added.

To create a new mapping, click **Create dotmailer Data Field mapping** in the upper-right corner of the **Data Field Mappings** page.

A form will emerge with the following fields to fill in within the **General** section:

* **Integration**   | Select your dotmailer integration.
* **Entity**        | Select the entity (e.g., **Contact**, etc).
* **Sync Priority** | If two or more entities are linked to 1 dotmailer contact, sync priority will be used to identify the master record.

Configure your mapping in the **Mapping Configuration** section of the same page.

The **Two Way Sync** check box should be selected if you want to update application entities with data from dotmailer.

### Perform Sync

Once you have configured mapping, tracking of changes will be performed automatically every 5 minutes. You can manually re-synchronize data fields on a required marketing list from its view page. To perform manual synchronization:

1. Open the marketing list connected to dotmailer.
2. Click **dotmailer** in the upper-right corner.
3. Click **Refresh Data Fields**.
