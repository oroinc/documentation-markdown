# Manage Customer Login Pages in the Back-Office

You can customize the content that appears on the login page of the storefront:

* Top content
* Bottom content
* CSS Styles
* Add a logo
* Add a background image

To edit the existing customer login page:

1. Navigate to **Marketing > Customer Login Pages** in the main menu.
2. Click <i class="fa fa-edit fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> at the end of the row.

   #### NOTE
   There is only one customer login page available, and you cannot create more. If you update the login page in one organization, the changes will be reflected in other existing organizations.
