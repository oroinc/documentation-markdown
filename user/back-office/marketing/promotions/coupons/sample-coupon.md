# Create a Sample Coupon

<!-- begin -->

As an illustration, let us create a sample promotion and generate 100 coupons. These coupons will be redeemed for orders placed by first-time customers. The promotion will offer a 20% discount for all orders between 1 March and 31 May 2024.

## Create a Promotion

As coupons must be linked to promotions, the first step is to create a new promotion:

1. Navigate to **Marketing > Promotions > Promotions** in the main menu.
2. Click **Coupons Actions > Create Promotion** on the top right.
3. In the form that opens, specify the discount details and items, making sure that the **Triggered by** field is set to *Coupons and Conditions*.
   The sample promotion is called **Spring Sale**, and the discount options are 20% off all orders.

4. Click **Save and Close**.

## Generate Coupons

Next, generate coupons for this promotion:

1. Navigate to **Marketing > Promotions > Coupons** in the main menu.
2. Click **Coupons Actions > Generate Multiple Coupons**.
3. In the pop-up that opens, specify the details of the coupons, making sure that the coupons are linked to the newly created *Spring Sale* promotion.

4. Click **Generate** once all the details are provided.

## Add Coupons to an Order in the Back-Office

Now that the promotion has been created and coupons generated, we can add a coupon to the order that fits the conditions of the discount.

1. Navigate to **Sales > Orders** in the main menu.
2. Select the relevant order and click on it once to open.
3. Click **Add Coupon Code** on the top right of the order page.
4. Select the coupon from the list, click **Add** and then  **Apply**.
5. The coupon for 20% off is now applied to the order.
