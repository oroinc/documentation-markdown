# Doctrine Field Types

Some entities have fields with data that is money or percents, so we have added new field types with these values.

The **money** field type allows to store money data. It is an alias for the decimal (19,4) type.

You can use this field type like:

```php
/**
 * @var decimal
 *
 * @ORM\Column(name="tax_amount", type="money")
 */
protected $taxAmount;
```

The **percent** field type allow to store percent data. It’s an alias to float type.

You can use this field type like:

```php
/**
 * @var float
 *
 * @ORM\Column(name="percent_field", type="percent")
 */
protected $percentField;
```

This two data types are available in extend fields. You can create new fields with these types. Additionally in view pages, in grids and in edit pages these fields will be automatically formatted with currency or percent formatters.

In the grid, for percent data type a generated percent filter will be automatically.

The **config_object** type maps and converts `Oro\Component\Config\Common\ConfigObject` based on PHP’s JSON encoding functions. Values retrieved from the database are always converted to `Oro\Component\Config\Common\ConfigObject` or null if no data is present.

You can use this field type like:

```php
/**
 * @var \Oro\Component\Config\Common\ConfigObject
 *
 * @ORM\Column(name="map_config", type="config_object")
 */
protected $mapConfigField;
```

The **duration** field type allows to store time duration in seconds. It is an alias for an integer type.

You can use this field type like:

```php
/**
 * @var int
 *
 * @ORM\Column(name="duration", type="duration")
 */
protected $duration;
```
