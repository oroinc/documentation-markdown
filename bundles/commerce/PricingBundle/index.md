# OroPricingBundle

<a href="https://github.com/oroinc/orocommerce/tree/master/src/Oro/Bundle/PricingBundle" target="_blank">OroPricingBundle</a> introduces prices for products in OroCommerce.

For back-office users (e.g. sales representatives), the bundle enables the following actions:

* Create overlapping price lists for products manually.
* Generate price lists for the product sets based on custom product assignment rules and price calculation rules.
* Configure the price list visibility for a specific customer, customer group, and website. The visibility settings may be either activated permanently or automatically enabled and disabled based on the scheduled time frames.
