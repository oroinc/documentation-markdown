# OroConsentBundle

OroConsentBundle extends the customer registration, checkout and RFQ submission processes in OroCommerce to allow for the collection of various mandatory and optional consents during registration, RFQ submission, and checkout.

This bundle includes the UI for admin users to create and manage the consents and manage their visibility.
The entire functionality of this bundle can be disabled through a feature toggle in the System Configuration UI.
