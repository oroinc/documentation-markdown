## oro:cron:platform:delete-old-number-sequences

The oro:cron:platform:delete-old-number-sequences command schedules deletion of old number sequences that are no longer needed. This is a cron command that runs daily at midnight and uses message queue for asynchronous processing.

```none
php bin/console oro:cron:platform:delete-old-number-sequences
```

The command only executes when number sequences exist in the database and processes deletion by grouping sequences by type and discriminator for efficient batch processing.
