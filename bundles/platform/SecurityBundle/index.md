# OroSecurityBundle

<a href="https://github.com/oroinc/platform/tree/master/src/Oro/Bundle/SecurityBundle" target="_blank">OroSecurityBundle</a> extends Symfony security capabilities to enable a role-based ACL security system in the Oro applications.

The bundle enables developers to set up access restrictions for entities and non-entity related actions using the PHP attributes and the YAML configuration files. It also provides UI for application administrators to configure the entity-specific permissions for particular user roles based on the entity ownership.

#### TIP
Take a look an how ACL works in the application in the [Access Levels and Ownership](../../../backend/security/example.md#backend-security-bundle-example) topic which illustrates the hierarchy of two sample organizations and access setup within them.
