# OroScopeBundle

OroScopeBundle introduces the Scope entity into the Oro applications. A scope is a set of application parameters that have different values in different requests.

OroScopeBundle enables developers to establish a relation between scopes and other application data, then calculate current scopes at runtime at any point of the application flow and obtain authorized data for the scope.

For the detailed information on the scope entity in the Oro applications, refer to the [Scopes](../../../backend/scopes/index.md#dev-scopes) topic.

<!-- comment: For working example of using scopes in Oro application, please check out the VisibilityBundle and AccountBundle code. -->
