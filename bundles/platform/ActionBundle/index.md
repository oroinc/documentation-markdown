# OroActionBundle

<a href="https://github.com/oroinc/platform/tree/6.1/src/Oro/Bundle/ActionBundle" target="_blank">OroActionBundle</a> enables the user interface actions definition and configuration using YAML configuration files.

On top of the common [Action Component](../../../backend/entities-data-management/actions/actions-conditions.md#bundle-docs-platform-action-bundle-action-component) and OroPlatform in general, ActionBundle provides a way to bring more complex solutions in ORO based projects with reusable components of configuration.
