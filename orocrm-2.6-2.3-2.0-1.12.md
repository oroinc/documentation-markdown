# OroCRM (Versions 2.6, 2.3, 2.0, 1.12)

In compliance with our release process, we no longer maintain the documentation for the previously released versions of OroCRM (v.2.6, 2.3, 2.0, 1.12). You can still access OroCRM <a href="https://oroinc.com/b2b-ecommerce/courses" target="_blank">Online Courses</a> and <a href="https://academy.oroinc.com/media-library/" target="_blank">Media Library</a>, as well as user and developer documentation for previous versions from our older OroCRM documentation source, as illustrated in the table below.

#### IMPORTANT
Please be aware that current documentation website contains OroCRM 2.6 documentation under 1.6 in the version dropdown control.

Please, review our [Release Process](community/release-process.md#doc-community-release) page for the information on the schedule of the currently maintained, supported, and upcoming releases.

As bug fixes are no longer provided for all older OroCRM versions, we highly recommend upgrading to the latest maintained version. To update your application, refer to the <a href="https://doc.oroinc.com/community/release-process/#upgrade-recommendations" target="_blank">Upgrade Recommendations</a> and [Upgrade Instructions](backend/setup/upgrade-to-new-version.md#upgrade) pages for more information.

Please be aware that we no longer accept issue reports for the previous version of OroCRM (v. 2.6, 2.3, 2.0, 1.12), with exception for security issues for version 2.6.

If you have encountered a documentation issue in OroCRM v. 2.6, 2.3, 2.0, 1.12, check documentation for the latest version, as your issue may have already been fixed. To report an issue in the current documentation, file a suggestion for improvement, or share your feedback, please, follow contribution instructions in the [Community Guide](community/report-issues/doc.md#report-doc-issue).
